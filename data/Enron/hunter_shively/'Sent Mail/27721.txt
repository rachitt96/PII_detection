The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weekend 
is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous 
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on &selling8 
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will 
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have 
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Super 
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions 
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron 
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant.   
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to have 
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees and 
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant 
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evaluate 
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron 
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages 
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will 
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We 
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To 
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the 
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students will 
rotate. 
In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates.  
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of 
the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that 
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation 
forms are completed and input prior to the meeting. 
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on 
Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday 
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 PM 
to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron,s executive management 
team.  Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.  Kevin Hannon, 
Jeff Shankman, John Lavorato, Rick Causey and Dan Leff will facilitate 
subsequent meetings. 
Need for interviewers.  There has been a tremendous response to the call for 
dinner participants; however, we are still in need of interviewers for each 
of the Super Saturdays.  Please respond with your willingness to interview 
at:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp    
(When selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who 
attend the schools for which you are a team member).
We thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program.
