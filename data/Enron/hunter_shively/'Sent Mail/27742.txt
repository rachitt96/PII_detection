Can we take one of your wonderchildren in fundementals and let them spend 1-2 
hours a day on VAR.  If yes, talk to Frank.

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas 
desk VaR dropped to $3.8


Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think 
it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider 
sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, 
maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to 
both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them 
to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts
