Issue#1)

It is not the physical microphone that is having the problem.  The microphone 
volume on the software declines as the speaker talks.

Does this happen using different microphones?
Brent: Can you swap the mic of an affected user and see if this persists?

I forwarded this request to our Product Marketing group. We have had this
request from other users as well. I will keep you updated on the response.

I spoke with Brent briefly a few moments ago and suggested changing the
jitter buffer value to 1. If the speech becomes choppy then we will have to
revert to 2 and put in a sniffer on the route to see if there is anything
hardware-wise that may be affecting the data throughput.
