New e-platform opens market to producers
E
nergyGateway.com yesterday unveiled a new marketing platform that will allow 
gas pro-ducers
to conduct online transactions under variable levels of service.
The move opens the door for small- and medium-sized producers to enter the 
online mar-ketplace,
EnergyGateway.com said. Its new electronic venture lets the producer choose 
its
level * including swing, interruptible and firm service * when the offer is 
made. This enables
buyers and sellers to transact for any term, raising the platform,s function 
above that of a
simple day-trading tool, according to EnergyGateway.com.
&Wholesale trading platforms have ignored the highly customized needs of 
producers and
consumers. All market participants value liquidity, competitive-based 
processes and access to
strategic information, not just trading companies,8 EnergyGateway.com CEO 
Mark Jergens
said. &Wholesale trading platforms essentially prohibit the sale of natural 
gas in the actual way
it is produced, flowed and transacted.8
By allowing more producers to compete online, EnergyGateway.com sees its 
program as
creating savings. &To create an optimum portal for buyers and sellers, we 
must have direct
contact with the producer community,8 Jergens explained. &By implementing 
this program,
we can provide a service to producers in any region of the country that want 
to participate in e-commerce
opportunities but cannot due to barrier of entry established by wholesalers.8
Columbus, Ohio-based EnergyGateway.com is an independent builder of 
e-communities,
offering transaction services and strategic market information for large 
natural gas and electric
suppliers and consumers. The company also plans to offer small business and 
residential custom-ers
a nationwide preferred provider network of natural gas and electric suppliers 
in 2001. VM
