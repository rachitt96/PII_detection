Subject : Procedures to confirm and execute storage contracts

Message Body :Going forward, I suggest the following.

Procedure for Storage Confirmation and Execution:

1.  Storage contracts mailed to trader.
2.  Trader forwards contract to short-term transport book
3.  Transport book verifies deal terms, sends a copy to back office, gets approriate signature on original, mail original to counterparty, contact counterparty to inform them that contract is executed and mailed back.
4.  Back office verifies terms, add contract to a binder, send copy to confirmation group.  
5.  Confirmation group verifies terms, add contract to their files, send a copy to Global group to scan contract in the system in order to view contract on-line via Information Management System
