Message Body :Great Hunter - I really appreciate you and Chris doing this. The audience does understand the basics of natural gas. Think of them as an originating sales force that hasn't had much access to the fundamental market information. We can get together sometime over the next couple of weeks to talk about some of this if you'd like. I'll be in touch anyway as we get closer to the date.
