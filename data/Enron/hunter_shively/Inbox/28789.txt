Message Body :Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more development of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operational capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to access the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built and maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as well as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage reports.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products instead of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you have any questions.
