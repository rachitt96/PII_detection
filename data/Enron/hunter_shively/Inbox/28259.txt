Message Body :Jeff,

Per our conversation.  My request is to make this 100,000 reduction a reduction in ENA's obligation under the Gas Purchase and Agency Agreement by and between The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company ("Buyer") and Enron North America Corp. ("Seller").  I need it to specify that our obligation for the month will be not greater than original obligation minus 100,000 mmbtu/d.

Thanx,
Laura

Jim,

As per our conversation, Peoples would like to sell 100,000 MMBtu/d of
citygate gas to ENA on a baseload basis during the month of December.  The
price of this sale is NGI Bidweek Chicago Index-flat.  As we discussed, PGL
will still receive its $0.03/MMBtu credit on the full Baseload contract
volumes in the agreement, however PGL and ENA agree to offset physical
volumes.  Therefore, ENA will deliver 100,000 MMBtu less to PGL each day in
December, and that reduction in volume will come from ENA's Northern Border
deliveries.

Call me if you have any questions.
