On other candidates:  Bill Read (MIC- NWS Houston) is considering whether to interview or not.  I will remain in contact with him.
		        Mark Walquist (Forecaster - Wilkens Weather) has declined to interview due to job security issues.
		        John Lewis (Lead Forecaster - NWS Little Rock) has declined to interview due to "happy where I am and no money can change my mind."
