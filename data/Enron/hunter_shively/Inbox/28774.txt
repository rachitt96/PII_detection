Steve Bennett is working on getting us in touch with Steve Lyons and possibly some other Weather Channel forecasters.  I have left 2 messages with Elliot Abrams...Lead Forecaster at AccuWeather.  He works the early morning shift and I asked him to email me or call me.  Robert Ricks is due in for an interview early next week.  Dave Ryan is contacting Matt Rogers at Eartsat.
