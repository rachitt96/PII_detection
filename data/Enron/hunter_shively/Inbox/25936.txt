Message Body :
Here is the summary you requested.  They appear to be about a third of the way thru the program (target approx. 100 BCF).  Tony told me that they hedged some fix price with Sempra yesterday, but I don't know the whole story.  They are continuing to pursue this idea of "Producer lock-ins" which, if executed, would reduce ENA's exposure with PGL.  Let me know what you think.
