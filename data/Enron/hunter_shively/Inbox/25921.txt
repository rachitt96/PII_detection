Message Body :Hunter,
Kevin has come up with another great idea.  How about a tab for contact names and phone numbers for our counterparties and pipeline representatives?  For Y2K a database was developed in Lotus Notes to accommodate this information.  The problem was that the fields were editable only by the assistants.  If we could develop an area in the fundys website that would allow the traders and schedulers access to update the information then I believe this would eliminate many of the phone lists that are kept individually and become a very useful tool for everyone.

Lisa,

I think it might be best to have an Off/Vacation tab where we can put each pipe individually with each scheduler's phone list, meter point, and dunns number to assist anyone who is filling in for someone. We could also build/expand to include other info as desired.
