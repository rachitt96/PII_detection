Hunter,

Below you will find attached the breakout of our sales between affiliated and third party markets.  I looked at one sample day, so the volumes listed under daily marketed volumes may switch between affiliated and third party on a daily basis.  These volumes will also fluctuate depending upon production.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
