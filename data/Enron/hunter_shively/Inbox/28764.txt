Message Body :Hi Hunter,

I tried sending you an email earlier but I didn't have
the right address.  How are things?  I am still
looking for a job.  I have attached a copy of my
resume to this email.  If anything comes your way
could you please let me know.  I am not necessarily
fixated on trading.  It would be optimal but I will do
anything else for now.
Thank you for everything,

Dayem
