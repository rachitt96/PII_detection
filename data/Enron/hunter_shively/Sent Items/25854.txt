Hunter, it appears that the bid week cycle for making IT based implementations actually falls five days prior and five days post bid week. Hence we cannot push the gas message board change without Director (business side) or above approval.

Thus on that note, please could forward this email to: David Wile (cc Bryan Lari, Colin Tonks, David Dronet) authorising this change so we can push the GMB asap. 

Thanks
Colin

We are in the middle of our bid week cycle.  I cannot implement this without director approval.
