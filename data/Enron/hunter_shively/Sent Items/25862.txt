Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical risk.   


 

Let me know if you need access to component VAR analysis, so that you can effectively manage VAR.
