Hunter,

Speaking with the above this morning, he indicated his interest in moving into gas as opposed to power (apparently got some good feedback on you ?!).  He currently works for Rogers Herndon and had also discussed with him his interest.

Let me have your feedback, and if you want him in your group,, I can switch him to gas fundies as opposed to power.

Karen.

ps.. attached again is the spread of new TT people.
