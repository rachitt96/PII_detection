1) When some of the members of the chat room begin to talk, their microphone 
volume starts to trail off.

2) Many of the users use the ctrl button in their daily activities.  The talk 
button needs to be changed to an F# key.

3) We have trouble with latency.

Please contract Brent Tiner to help with these issues.

Thank You
Hunter
