Please note that as of Monday, October 30, Northern Natural Gas will commence 
transacting for capacity on EnronOnline. In accordance with FERC

information with regard to NNG activities which is not in the public domain.

For at least the next several months, NNG will be using EnronOnline and 
sharing the same database. We have agreed a policy with NNG that ENA 
employees will not obtain commercial information with regard to NNG
