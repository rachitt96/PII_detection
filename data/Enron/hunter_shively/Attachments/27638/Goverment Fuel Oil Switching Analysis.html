<FONT color="#0000A0" face="Arial" size="2">In January 2000, prices for heating oil, the oil consumers use to heat
 their homes, increased dramatically in the Northeastern United States.
 As a result, many consumers were faced with unexpectedly high heating bills
 as the weather turned colder. The level and duration of the price increase
 prompted the President to ask Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson to examine
 opportunities for converting factories and major users from oil to other
 fuels, which will help to free up future oil supplies for use in heating
 homes.</FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
In response to the President&#146;s request, this study examines how the distillate
 fuel oil market (and related energy markets) in the Northeast behaved in
 the winter of 1999-2000, explains the role played by residential, commercial,
 industrial, and electricity generation sector consumers in distillate fuel
 oil markets and describes how that role is influenced by the structure
 of the energy markets in the Northeast. In addition, this report explores
 the potential for nonresidential users to move away from distillate fuel
 oil and how this might impact future prices, and discusses conversion of
 distillate fuel oil users to other fuels over the next 5 years. Because
 the President&#146;s and Secretary&#146;s request focused on converting factories
 and other large-volume users of mostly high-sulfur distillate fuel oil
 to other fuels,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> transportation sector use of low-sulfur distillate fuel
 oil is not examined here.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Fuel switching and conversion from distillate fuel oil to a different fuel
 can occur in either of two ways, depending on the time frame available.
 In the short term, existing equipment that has dual-fuel (e.g., distillate
 and natural gas) switching capability can be used. In the longer term,
 other equipment may be amenable to retrofits or replacements.<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
In mid-January 2000, prices for distillate fuel oil<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#3"><SUP>3</SUP></a> and natural gas rose
 dramatically in the Northeast. For example, between January 14 and February
 4, 2000, New York Harbor spot prices for home heating oil (generally, high-sulfur
 Number 2 distillate fuel oil) rose from $0.76 to $1.77 per gallon, a 133-percent
 increase. Over a similar period, from January 11 to January 21, 2000, the
 New York spot prices for natural gas rose from $2.65 to $11.75 per million
 Btu, an increase of more than 340 percent. Retail prices for distillate
 fuel oil&#151;the prices faced by consumers&#151;rose less dramatically but still
 showed strong increases. For example, between January 17 and February 7,
 2000, the average price of home heating oil for residential customers in
 New England rose from $1.18 to $1.96 per gallon, a 66-percent increase.
 For the typical household with a 275-gallon tank that was filled up at
 the peak price, the increase amounted to approximately $140 for an average
 fill-up (two-thirds of a tank). During the same period, the New England
 retail price of&nbsp;diesel fuel (low-sulfur distillate used for transportation)
 rose from $1.44 to $2.12 per gallon, a 47-percent increase.<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#4"><SUP>4</SUP></a> In February,
 the return to warmer weather and the arrival of new distillate supplies,
 mainly in the form of imports, relieved the market imbalance and prices
 fell.

<FONT color="#0000A0" face="Arial" size="2">In the markets for distillate fuel oil, as in all competitive markets,
 the balancing of supply and demand sets prices. Any factor that leads to
 a significant imbalance&#151;insufficient supply to meet demand or, vice versa,
 supply that exceeds demand&#151;can cause sharp price changes. The key factors
 that influence prices in distillate fuel oil markets include supply and
 demand in</FONT>
<FONT color="#0000A0" face="Arial" size="2">
the world crude oil market, supply and demand in the markets for competing
 fuels (such as natural gas), the status of distillate fuel oil refining
 and delivery capacity, the level of stocks held by wholesalers and retailers,
 and weather-induced fluctuations in demand. The last factor, weather, is
 especially important in the market for home heating oil, because its chief
 uses are for heating homes in the Northeast and meeting the marginal fuel
 requirements of some industrial plants and power plants when demand is
 high and other fuels are not available.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<FONT color="#0000A0" face="Arial" size="2">Sharp movements in any combination of the factors mentioned above can cause,
 and historically have caused, significant swings in distillate fuel oil
 prices. In the winter of 1999-2000, several factors appear to have played
 key roles in the price increases seen in the Northeast: rapidly rising
 world oil prices, lower than normal inventories of distillate fuel oil,
 adverse weather conditions, constraints on natural gas pipeline capacity
 in some areas of the Northeast, and delivery and production problems for
 distillate fuel oil. These factors taken together led to the sharp increases
 in distillate fuel oil and natural gas prices seen in the Northeast in
 mid-January 2000.</FONT>
      </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
When the colder weather hit in January, consumers increased their demand
 for both home heating oil and natural gas, and prices rose. Because distillate
 fuel oil stocks were below normal levels, quickly available supplies were
 limited and prices responded sharply to the increase in demand. At the
 same time, the demand for natural gas in the region stretched the capacity
 of some pipelines, and natural gas customers on interruptible contracts,
 mainly distillate-switchable large industrial and power plants,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#5"><SUP>5</SUP></a> were asked
 to switch to their alternative fuel&#151;primarily, distillate fuel oil. When
 customers seeking to avoid high natural gas prices and interruptible natural
 gas customers entered the distillate fuel oil market, the upward pressure
 on distillate oil prices increased still further.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Coming into the winter of 1999-2000, world oil prices rose dramatically.
 After several years of low prices, the price of crude oil rose from approximately
 $12 per barrel<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#6"><SUP>6</SUP></a> in February 1999 to about $34 per barrel in early March
 2000&#151;still much lower than the record high world oil price of $70 per barrel
 (in 1999 dollars) seen in&nbsp;1981. Members of the Organization of Petroleum
 Exporting Countries (OPEC) and key non-OPEC countries, notably, Mexico
 and Norway, had reduced their production in response to the low crude oil
 prices in 1997 and 1998. The production decline, in combination with increased
 consumption in industrialized countries and Southeast Asia, led to an imbalance
 in world crude oil supply and demand: more was being consumed than produced.
 This, in turn, led to a drawdown of world crude oil inventories.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
A related drawdown occurred in distillate fuel oil inventories. With crude
 oil prices rising faster than product prices in 1999, refiners saw their
 operating margins shrinking. In response, they reduced their purchases
 of expensive crude oil and their production of refined products, including
 distillate fuel oil. The production cutbacks contributed to a nationwide
 drawdown of distillate fuel oil inventories toward the end of 1999. Given
 the normal stocks and the relatively warm weather in early December, the
 drawdown in December was stronger than expected, particularly in the Northeast.<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#7"><SUP>7</SUP></a>
 For example, in New England stocks of high-sulfur distillate fuel oil fell
 by 35 percent, from 11.6 million barrels in early December to 7.5 million
 barrels in early January. Similarly, in the Central Atlantic,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#8"><SUP>8</SUP></a> high-sulfur
 distillate fuel oil stocks fell by 24 percent, from 24.5 million barrels
 in early December to 18.6 million barrels in early February. Although heating
 oil inventories often decline in December, the magnitude of the stock draw
 was greater than expected from historic patterns.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
When cold weather hit in January, low stocks could provide little supply,
 and prices reacted strongly. During the week of January 22, 2000, temperatures
 in the New England and Middle Atlantic areas shifted from being 15 to 17
 percent warmer than normal, respectively, to 24 and 22 percent colder than
 normal. The change increased weekly heating requirements by about 40 percent.
 As a result, the demand for distillate fuel oil increased in all segments
 of the market. Residential and commercial consumers increased their use
 of distillate fuel oil to heat their homes and businesses, power companies
 increased their use to meet the demand for electricity (in some cases by
 switching from natural gas), and industrial customers with dual-fired facilities
 increased their use of distillate fuel oil by switching from natural gas,
 either as required by their gas supply contracts or to avoid the higher
 price of natural gas. The problem of unexpected rapid increases in demand
 for distillate fuel oil was aggravated by serious delivery problems. For
 example, Coast Guard ice breakers worked overtime to keep the Hudson River
 open during the coldest weather, and high winds and rough water in Long
 Island Sound made it too difficult for barges to unload heating oil from
 a waiting tanker in New Haven, Connecticut, in early February.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
The pressure put on distillate fuel oil markets by the sudden change in
 weather was exacerbated by relatively high natural gas prices. In some
 uses like boilers or generators, natural gas and distillate fuel oil can
 be substitutes for one another. If the price of one rises relative to the
 other, some consumers&#151;mostly large industrial facilities or power plants&#151;will
 switch to the other fuel. In October 1999, wellhead and spot market prices
 for natural gas were 35 percent and 60 percent higher, respectively, than
 in October 1998. The increase was due in part to higher prices for competing
 fuels and in part to expectations of higher natural gas consumption if
 normal weather patterns developed.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
When the weather turned colder in the Northeast in late December 1999,
 natural gas spot prices for delivery to the New York citygate rose substantially.
 Early in December natural gas prices were generally below $3.00 per million
 Btu, but on December 21 they rose to $4.11, and they stayed between $3.55
 and $4.87 per million Btu through December 29. New York citygate prices
 fell substantially in early January 2000, before rising to $6.34 per million
 Btu on January 18. Gas traded above $6.00 per million Btu on a majority
 of the days between January 13 and February 13. Gas pipeline capacity into
 the Northeast was heavily utilized during the period. Several pipeline
 companies indicated that they had reached new peak levels for service;
 representatives of one company, Transco, testified that they had no interruptible
 capacity available on their system from October 20 to the date of the testimony,
 February 24, 2000.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
In general, the ability to bring natural gas into the Northeast is more
 limited than in other areas of the country. The region receives the majority
 of its natural gas supplies through a single supply corridor from the Southwest
 through Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In addition, the Northeast markets
 are separated from major natural gas supply areas in the U.S. Southwest
 and western Canada by substantial distances.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Although New York citygate natural gas prices and New York Harbor distillate
 fuel oil prices are about equally volatile, retail natural gas prices to
 residential customers appear to be less volatile than retail heating oil
 prices. For residential natural gas customers, the distribution charges
 added by local distribution companies (about $4.00 per million Btu) mute
 the effects of citygate price volatility. Further, the purchasing and billing
 practices of natural gas distribution companies also can obscure short-term
 price fluctuations.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
To address the surge in heating fuel prices, the Federal Government responded
 with release of funds from the&nbsp;Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), to relieve some of the financial burden to low-income households.
 The surge in distillate home heating oil prices subsided four weeks after
 it started.

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Among customer types in the Northeast, residential consumers are by far
 the largest users of distillate fuel oil,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#9"><SUP>9</SUP></a> excluding transportation use.
 In 1997 they accounted for&nbsp;more than two-thirds (68 percent) of the distillate
 fuel consumption in the region. The entire buildings sector&#151;residential
 plus commercial users&#151;accounted for more than 90 percent of total distillate
 fuel oil consumption in the region. Industrial firms and power plants accounted
 for smaller shares, 8 percent and 2 percent, respectively, on an annual
 basis. However, while small on an annual basis, the role played by industrial
 users and power plants can vary significantly during the course of a year.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
In the residential sector, distillate fuel oil is mostly used for home
 heating, primarily in the Northeast. Nationwide, distillate fuel oil accounted
 for only 8 percent of the energy delivered to the residential sector in
 1997, but 73 percent of that consumption occurred in the Northeast. Homes
 in the Northeast rely on home heating oil for heating because heating oil
 prices compare favorably to other heating fuels in the region. Even with
 the occasional surge in heating oil prices, historically, heating with
 distillate fuel oil in the Northeast has been less expensive than heating
 with natural gas. An illustrative example, using actual household heating
 bills, estimated that a house on Long Island saved $1,800 in fuel costs
 (in real 1999 dollars) over the past 20 years by continuing to use heating
 oil rather than switching to natural gas for heating. Although natural
 gas heating systems tend to be slightly more efficient than comparable
 oil heating systems, the study assumed for simplicity of presentation that
 their efficiencies were equal. In that sense, the analysis overestimates
 the fuel savings that resulted from staying on heating oil. On the other
 hand, the savings are even larger when the cost of the new gas furnace
 needed to switch fuels is included.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Over the past 20 years, residential use of distillate fuel oil in the Northeast
 has declined by 20 percent, and the number of customers using it has declined
 by 10 percent. Efficiency gains in building shells and furnaces, combined
 with warmer winters, have contributed to the&nbsp;decline. In addition, the construction
 of new gas pipelines into the region has given more consumers the choice
 between distillate fuel oil and natural gas. Since 1993, however, distillate
 fuel oil prices have been relatively low, allowing it to maintain a 30-percent
 share of the heating market in new homes in the region. Projections from
 the <I>Annual Energy Outlook 2000</I> (<I>AEO2000</I>) show this trend continuing over
 the next 5 years.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Although generally small in comparison with residential use, distillate
 fuel oil use in other sectors in the Northeast can have a significant impact
 on prices, especially when demand is strong and supplies are tight. As
 in the residential sector, distillate fuel oil use in the commercial sector
 has declined over the past 20 years, and its use is expected to continue
 to decline over the next 5 years. In the commercial sector, distillate
 fuel oil consumption declined from 18 percent of total commercial energy
 use in the Northeast in 1980 to 12 percent in 1997. Typically, distillate
 fuel oil is used in the commercial sector for heating, water heating, cooking,
 and electricity generation. Using 1995 data for buildings whose owners
 reported that they could switch heating fuels without any new equipment
 purchases or retrofits, it is estimated that just under a quarter (52 trillion
 Btu or about 9 million barrels) of the distillate fuel oil used in the
 commercial sector in the Northeast could be switched to other fuels, such
 as natural gas.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
In the industrial sector, distillate fuel oil is a relatively minor fuel,
 accounting for only 4 percent of total U.S. industrial fuel consumption
 in 1997. In the Northeast, the 79 trillion Btu (about 13.5 million barrels)
 of industrial distillate fuel oil consumption in 1997 accounted for only
 3 percent of total industrial fuel consumption. The consumption of distillate
 fuel oil in the industrial sector in the Northeast is divided nearly equally
 between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing uses. In the nonmanufacturing
 segment, where distillate fuel oil is used primarily for on-site transportation
 (moving things around the plant and farm sites), it is unlikely that a
 significant portion of it could be easily switched to another fuel. Within
 the manufacturing segment in the Northeast the key uses of distillate are
 as a boiler fuel (37 percent), as a process fuel (32 percent), for heating
 and ventilation (12 percent), and for on-site transportation (9.8 percent).
 Using 1994 data,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#10"><SUP>10</SUP></a> it is estimated that approximately 24 percent (9 trillion
 Btu or about 1.6 million barrels) of the distillate fuel oil used in the
 Northeast manufacturing segment could be switched quickly to other fuels
 without equipment purchases or retrofits. Over the next 5 years, distillate
 fuel use in the Northeast industrial sector is expected to increase by
 just over</FONT> <FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
1 percent annually, but the rate could vary depending on oil prices.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Oil plays a small role in the electricity generation sector, and generation
 from distillate fuel oil is a very small portion of that. In 1998, oil
 accounted for less than 3.4 percent of total U.S. electricity generation,
 and generation from distillate fuel oil accounted for only 0.4 percent
 of total generation. Overall, the share of generation from oil has been
 declining for some time, as natural gas has become more available and the
 efficiency of new natural gas generating technologies has continued to
 improve. This trend is expected to continue over the next 5 years. Even
 in the early 1980s, when oil-fired generation was more important, the share
 from distillate fuel oil never exceeded 1 percent. The vast majority of
 the oil used for electricity generation is residual fuel oil.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
In the Northeast the power generation sector is more dependent on oil than
 in other parts of the country. For example, in New England 24 percent of
 generation comes from oil. Even in these more oil-dependent regions, however,
 distillate fuel oil plays a small role&#151; only 6 percent of total oil generation.
 Distillate fuel oil is typically used in small amounts in steam plants
 for flame control and in relatively inefficient combustion turbines and
 internal combustion engines when the demand for electricity is high and
 other fuels are unavailable to generate electricity. If all the distillate
 fuel oil use in the power generation sector in the Northeast were switched
 to another fuel&#151;most likely, natural gas&#151;it would amount to about 35 trillion
 Btu (6.1 million barrels) of distillate fuel oil. Under more severe weather
 conditions, as experienced in December 1989, the annual consumption could
 rise to as much as 41 trillion Btu (7.1 million barrels). It is unreasonable
 to assume, however, that all of that fuel use could be quickly switched.
 Some of the plants that burn distillate fuel oil are not dual-fired and
 may not have easy access to natural gas.

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
In summary, on an annual basis, if all the distillate fuel oil used in
 the Northeast commercial, industrial, and electric power sectors that could
 conceivably switch (even with equipment purchases and retrofits) were replaced
 with another fuel, total distillate fuel oil use would be reduced by 33.6
 million barrels. However, as discussed earlier, it is unlikely that all
 of this distillate fuel oil use could be switched to another fuel. Looking
 only at the quantity of consumption that is estimated to be reasonably
 switchable,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#11"><SUP>11</SUP></a> the total that could be made available for residential use
 is only 13.1 million barrels.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
We believe this to be a high estimate of the distillate fuel switching
 potential in the Northeast.<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#12"><SUP>12</SUP></a> In addition, as is explained later, the reduction
 in nonresidential distillate fuel use may not lead to a permanent increase
 in supplies available for home heating, and the volatility in the market
 may not be reduced.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Because the use of distillate fuel oil varies significantly across the
 seasons, it is more important to look at the potential for reducing nonresidential
 sector use during the winter months, when the use of distillate fuel oil
 for heating is greatest and rapid price increases are most likely. Using
 historical information about the distribution of seasonal use of distillate
 fuel oil in the commercial, industrial, and electricity generation sectors,
 it is estimated that the volume of their winter season switchable distillate
 use could be as high as 133,000 barrels per day&#151;about 11 percent of residential
 heating oil use in the winter (Table ES1).

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Because the Northeast&#146;s residential sector is highly dependent on home
 heating oil, whose prices are normally highest in the winter, colder-than-normal
 winter weather will further increase the demand and prices for heating
 oil. If, in addition, heating oil resupply problems are coupled with additional
 distillate fuel oil demand of 100,000 to 133,000 barrels per day from interruptible
 and/or fuel-switchable customers, home heating oil prices could rise sharply,
 as they did in the winter of 1999-2000.</FONT></P>

Homeowners can be given increased access to distillate fuel oil or, at

 of the Northeast distillate fuel oil market (for example, with better planning

Natural Gas Market Effects
</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Possible changes to natural gas use considered in this report include (1)
 keeping large consumers with &#147;switchable&#148; equipment (that can use either
 fuel) from moving to distillate fuel oil when gas prices are high; and
 (2) in combination with keeping switchable firms on&nbsp;natural gas, moving
 some of the &#147;distillate-only&#148; capacity<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#13"><SUP>13</SUP></a> to natural gas. In this analysis
 it is estimated that, over a 3-month winter period (contiguous December,
 January, and February), the maximum &#147;average-day&#148; switchable fuel consumption<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#14"><SUP>14</SUP></a>
 is equivalent to about 133,000 barrels of distillate fuel oil per day.
 No</FONT> <FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
three-month winter period in the past 20 years has had average-day switchable
 distillate consumption that exceeded this average. On very cold winter
 days, however, switchable consumption may be higher for brief periods.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
The conversion of distillate fuel oil consumers to natural gas by 2005
 depends on the economics (end-use equipment and gas supply costs) and the
 effectiveness of their implementation. Because the ultimate effectiveness
 of policy initiatives cannot be known in advance, the estimates used in
 this report are sensitivities representing different sizes of the market
 that might be moved away from distillate fuel oil. A commitment to switch
 to natural gas usually means that the consumer will also have to commit
 to firm contracts for supply, transportation, and local delivery of the
 gas.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Conversion from distillate to natural gas would require a natural gas supply
 line and gas burners in existing distillate-burning equipment, such as
 boilers or turbines. Alternatively, installation of a new system that burns
 a different fuel may be considered when fuel price differences are expected
 to be large for some time (economic conversion) or when the original equipment
 fails and needs to be replaced or repaired. The rate of equipment failure
 is likely to be the primary factor affecting market opportunities for conversions
 from distillate fuel oil to other fuels.

The Northeast receives 71 percent of its current natural gas supply<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#15"><SUP>15</SUP></a> from
 net inflows from other U.S. regions, 24 percent from international imports,
 and 2 percent in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Less
 than 3 percent of the supply comes from production in the Northeast region,
 all of which occurs in the Mid-Atlantic Census division. New England is
 highly dependent on flows from other U.S. regions, obtaining 89 percent
 of its&nbsp;current supply from the domestic transportation network.

Natural gas flow from the Sable Island pipeline project began in the first
 week of January 2000 to serve parts of New England and Eastern Canada.
 The pipeline was first forced to shut down on January 7, 2000, due to hydrate
 formation in a subsea line (essentially, ice sludge blockage).<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#16"><SUP>16</SUP></a> The second
 shutdown occurred in mid-January, when the gas processing plant developed
 a gas leak and was again shut down for repair.<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#17"><SUP>17</SUP></a> Early gas flow reached
 about 110 million cubic feet per day, of which 36 million cubic feet per
 day entered U.S. markets. By early March, the gas flow was about 300 million
 cubic feet per day to markets in the United States. The Sable Island project
 is expected to reach flows of 450 million cubic feet per day by summer
 2000, the majority of which is expected to serve U.S. markets.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Pipeline capacity entering the entire Northeast region was 12,519 million
 cubic feet per day at the beginning of 1999. If large-volume users with
 dual-fired capability switched from distillate to natural gas, 839 million
 cubic feet per day of additional pipeline capacity would be needed. By
 2005, the additional new capacity required, relative to the beginning of
 1999, to provide gas service to the converted customers and to supply the
 baseline increase in gas use could reach 2,241 million cubic feet per day.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
A number of recently completed pipeline expansion projects (including the
 completed expansion from Canada&#146;s Sable Island gas fields to New England),
 as well as the proposed Millennium, Independence, and associated projects,
 are intended to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the Middle Atlantic
 and New England regions. Although the demand for natural gas in the Northeast
 is expected to grow, all pipeline construction projects must satisfy a
 number of State, environmental, and regulatory requirements and gain public
 acceptance before they are approved and considered certain. Consequently,
 the fate of any proposed project remains uncertain until final approval
 is received. The current proposals alone represent about 2 billion cubic
 feet per day of potential additional capacity, well in excess of the additional
 capacity that would be needed on a peak day (839 million cubic feet per
 day) to address the new gas demand resulting from switching out of distillate,
 and nearly enough for the additional 2005 potential requirements, including
 the baseline projected growth in natural gas consumption. The Sable Island
 gas supply project (about 400 million cubic feet per day to New England)
 also appears to be more than adequate to handle the additional capacity
 (340 million cubic feet per day) needed to address New England&#146;s portion
 of the new switching to gas, leaving the need for an additional 506 million
 cubic feet per day to support the potential conversions through 2005 (see
 Chapter 4 of this report).

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Serving the switchable market with natural gas appears to be physically
 feasible by fall 2002 with projects already built or with construction
 of expansion projects planned for the Northeast; however, those projects
 were not intended to provide firm service to current interruptible customers.
 Because of the lack of sufficient commitments, the construction dates for
 proposed pipeline projects to the Northeast, such as Market Link, are uncertain.
 Even if the proposed projects are built, at least 250 million cubic feet
 per day of additional capacity would be necessary to also serve the new
 potential conversion customers in 2005. Because the planned pipelines were
 sized and targeted for specific customers with specific operating requirements
 (e.g., pressures), the system may not be capable of serving all the additional
 requirements of the former distillate users and, therefore, could require
 even more additional capacity than estimated. One of the major hurdles
 that potential new Federal policies must overcome, however, appears to
 be economic. For industrial consumers and electricity generators with the
 capability to switch between natural gas and distillate fuel oil, firm
 year-round contracts for natural gas may not be economical in the Northeast.
 The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities findings on pipeline construction
 for interruptible customers are consistent with this study:<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#18"><SUP>18</SUP></a>
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
&#147;To design and construct a gas distribution system to serve the interruptible
 customer class on a year-round basis would require significant investment
 and take years to install. Furthermore, on a cost of service basis, the
 resultant tariff rates would undoubtedly make it uneconomical for large
 customers to avail themselves of year-round service. Therefore, absent
 the current interruptible service offerings by natural gas utilities, larger
 customers would burn an alternate fuel continuously and further complicate
 the supply situation.&#148;
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Through 2005, several potential obstacles or unintended consequences are
 possible if establishments with current dual-fuel switchable systems become
 firm natural gas customers. Because any capability to meet the new load
 will require pipeline and storage capacity expansion that is sufficient
 to meet the new peak, the costs of the incremental pipeline and storage
 capacity will have to be recovered from new customers, as is usually the
 current policy of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Otherwise,
 costs to existing firm gas customers (usually residential and small commercial
 customers) will increase. Firm transportation capacity has proved to be
 too costly for fuel-switchable customers in the past.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
When interruptible customers use the natural gas system, at least some
 of the resulting revenues are applied to reducing transportation costs
 for firm customers, including residential users, for whom the pipelines
 were originally justified and built. If interruptible natural gas customers
 became firm customers, unless uncommitted capacity were available for firm
 service, new capacity would have to be built. Their previous purchases
 of interruptible service would no longer benefit the firm customers on
 existing capacity by reducing their costs. Further, pipeline operators
 would be faced with more unused off-peak capacity to auction off, with
 a very limited base of seasonal users, thereby reducing the value of the
 interruptible capacity. Pipeline companies currently gain some revenues
 from the sale of interruptible capacity. There could be a considerable
 loss of efficiency in the operation of the gas market and the economy in
 general if switchable capacity were kept on natural gas all year round.

Distillate Fuel Market Effects
</FONT></B>
      </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
While the elimination of incremental distillate fuel oil demand from customers
 switching from natural gas at peak is likely to reduce the potential for
 distillate fuel oil price spikes in the short term because of the overcapacity
 created, it cannot eliminate their possibility in the longer term, and
 it could increase the volatility of natural gas prices. Successful conversion
 of large-volume customers from distillate to natural gas could also exacerbate
 the potential for distillate price spikes, because it would remove a stable
 base of heating oil consumption. The remaining distillate fuel oil market
 would be smaller, consisting of the portion of current customers with a
 stronger seasonal usage pattern. Thus, distillate fuel oil dealers and
 refineries would be inclined to reduce inventories given the smaller market,
 the relative swing between seasons could be larger, and inventory management
 could be more difficult and uncertain. As the stock cushion diminished,
 the distillate fuel oil market could become less prepared for sudden increases
 in demand or decreases in supply.

Current Market Mechanisms
</FONT></B>
      </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Simple and relatively low-cost market mechanisms are&nbsp;already provided by
 distillate and natural gas distributors to soften price shocks created
 by weather. About 98 percent of the Northeast heating oil dealers participating
 in a voluntary survey offer a budget payment plan,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#19"><SUP>19</SUP></a> as do all gas utilities.
 The budget plans estimate the annual heating bill and allow customers to
 pay 11 equal amounts plus a 12th payment that reconciles any discrepancy
 in collections. Other pricing mechanisms that can minimize the risk of
 price shocks include price caps and guaranteed pricing.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
About 54 percent of the Northeast oil dealers responding to a voluntary
 survey indicated that they provide price cap programs on distillate fuel
 oil to residential customers for a small &#147;insurance&#148; premium, and 55 percent
 offer guaranteed pricing. For a small premium per-gallon charge, dealers
 cap the maximum price they charge to residential customers. Others simply
 offer a fixed price per gallon charge for a 12-month period. These programs,
 for customers who had chosen them, would have lessened the financial pain
 of the 1999-2000 surge in winter distillate prices or completely insulated
 the customers from it. The extent of participation in these payment programs
 is not known; however, the persistence of relatively low world oil prices
 for all but one of the past 8 years suggests that they may not have been
 widely used.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Some existing market mechanisms are already available to mitigate future
 heating oil price spikes, including: (1) for large-volume, distillate-natural
 gas switchable users, maintaining adequate distillate fuel oil backup at
 the start of the winter season to reduce the potential for large intrusions
 into the heating oil market during very cold periods; (2) for residential
 consumers who buy new oil-heated homes, installing a larger oil tank to
 reduce the number of required fill-ups during the peak period; (3) for
 residential heating oil customers, adopting any one of the fuel oil purchasing
 plans (budget plan, cap price, or fixed price) that will meet their preferences
 for avoiding risks; (4) for all residential heating oil consumers, adding
 additional conservation measures, buying more efficient heating systems
 when they need to be replaced, and, in some cases, switching to a different
 fuel. As recent reports in the press have indicated, some Northeast consumers
 have reacted to the recent price spike by switching to natural gas or by
 purchasing high-efficiency heating systems, or are seriously considering
 switching to a more predictable heating oil plan. As a result of recent
 hearings by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the Board noted that
 it will reconsider reimposing the requirement that interruptible gas customers
 maintain adequate alternate fuel supplies:
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
&#147;Given the magnitude of the [distillate volumes] involved, it is unlikely
 that this would have a significant effect on the price of heating oil.
 It is, however, worth considering as part of a future, overall response
 plan.&#148;<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#20"><SUP>20</SUP></a>
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
Other market approaches that are available for the electricity generation
 market include the expansion of interregional transmission capability and
 the construction and expanded use of nuclear, coal and renewables generation.
 Besides switching to other fuels for generation, regional distillate fuel
 oil use could be reduced by increasing interregional electricity transmission
 capacity and/or building new capacity to displace existing capacity. Given
 the high cost and long lead times for building new transmission capacity,
 however, displacing intermittent use of distillate fuel oil by electricity
 generators may not be an economical choice.
</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT color="#0000A0" size="2" face="Arial">
New gas-fired plants can be brought on line in 1 to 2 years, and many are
 already planned. Other new capacity types&#151;coal, wind, biomass, nuclear
 and solar&#151;are much less economical than gas and normally take longer to
 bring on line. In addition, because wind and solar are not dispatchable,<a HREF="execs_fnote.html#21"><SUP>21</SUP></a>
 they probably are not good substitutes for plants that use distillate fuel
 oil. The industrial sector already uses the maximum available amounts of
 black liquor and residues for cogeneration applications. Other incremental
 cogeneration opportunities are small in the 2000-2005 time frame without
 substantial financial incentives. The situation in the residential and
 commercial sectors is similar.
