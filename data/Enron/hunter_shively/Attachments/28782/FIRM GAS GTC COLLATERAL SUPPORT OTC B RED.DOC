Transactions may be formed in a telephone conversation between the parties that may be recorded by Company whereby an offer and acceptance shall constitute the valid and enforceable agreement of the parties subject to this GTC.  Any Transaction formed pursuant to the foregoing shall be considered a "writing" or "in writing" and to have been "signed" and any tape recording thereof shall constitute an "original" document evidencing the Transaction.  The parties agree not to contest or assert a defense to the validity or enforceability of telephonic Transactions entered into in accordance with this GTC under laws relating to (i) whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the party to be thereby bound or (ii) the authority of any employee of such party.  Upon issuance of any Confirmation, if no objection to the Confirmation has been received in accordance with applicable law, the Confirmation and this GTC shall be conclusive evidence of the Transaction made the subject matter thereof and the final expression of all of its terms.  All Transactions hereunder and all transactions made pursuant to the Firm Gas General Terms & Conditions (Online), but transacted on the Website therein defined, shall be considered a single master agreement until such time as the foregoing are hereafter governed by a master agreement between the parties as may be therein set forth.  In the event of any inconsistency between the Transaction (as may be evidenced by a Confirmation thereof, if any) and this GTC or any master agreement that may govern the Transaction as set forth in the preceding sentence, the terms of the Transaction shall govern.  {\b [Company may book, and make and receive payments under, any Transaction at any one of its branches in the following territories or countries:  England and Wales, France, Hong Kong, United States of America, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland, which branch shall be identified in any applicable Transaction or Confirmation.

The \plain\b\f2\fs20 Daily Contract Quantity\plain\f2\fs20  shall be scheduled on a firm basis by \plain\b\f2\fs20 Seller \plain\f2\fs20 and \plain\b\f2\fs20 Buyer \plain\f2\fs20 at the \plain\b\f2\fs20 Delivery Point(s)\plain\f2\fs20  during the \plain\b\f2\fs20 Period of Delivery\plain\f2\fs20  and at the \plain\b\f2\fs20 Contract Price \plain\f2\fs20 as such terms are designated in each Transaction.  Unless excused by Force Majeure (defined in \plain\f2\fs20\ul Section 4\plain\f2\fs20 ) or the other party's failure to perform its obligations hereunder, if on any day a party fails to schedule on a firm basis the Daily Contract Quantity, then such occurrence shall constitute a "\plain\f2\fs20\ul Deficiency Breach\plain\f2\fs20 " and the "\plain\f2\fs20\ul Deficiency Quantity\plain\f2\fs20 " shall be the numerical difference between the Daily Contract Quantity and the amount of gas scheduled.  Upon a Deficiency Breach, the party failing to schedule the Deficiency Quantity shall pay to the other party an amount equal to the \plain\f2\fs20\ul sum\plain\f2\fs20  of the product of the Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Replacement Price Differential (below defined) \plain\f2\fs20\ul plus\plain\f2\fs20  $0.15 multiplied by the Deficiency Quantity.

\par 
"\plain\f2\fs20\ul Spot Price\plain\f2\fs20 " means{\b [, subject to }\plain\f2\fs20\ul {\b Section 6}\plain\f2\fs20 {\b ,]} the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in \plain\f2\fs20\ul Gas {\strike \{Daily\'ae\}}{\b [Daily}\plain\f2\fs20  {\b \'ae]}, or successor publication, in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geographic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the relevant day{\strike \{. If\}}{\b [; provided, if]} there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price for that particular day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices under the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average of such "Common" high and low prices.  \par 
\par 
"\plain\f2\fs20\ul Business Day\plain\f2\fs20 " means a day on which Federal Reserve member banks in New York City are open for business and a Business Day shall open at 8:00 a.m. and close at 5:00 p.m. local time at each party's principal place of business.\par

On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, the non-defaulting party shall in good faith calculate its Gains, Losses and Costs (each below defined) resulting from the termination of the parties' obligations under all Transactions with respect to all Payment Dates (defined in \plain\f2\fs20\ul Section 6\plain\f2\fs20 ) which would have occurred on or after the Early Termination Date had the Early Termination Date not occurred.  The Gains and Losses for each terminated Transaction shall be determined by calculating the amount that would be incurred or realized to replace or to provide the economic equivalent of the remaining payments or deliveries in respect of that terminated Transaction.  The non-defaulting party or its agent may determine its Gains and Losses by reference to information either available to it internally or supplied by one or more third parties, including, without limitation, either firm or indicative quotations of relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, or other relevant market data in the relevant markets.  Third parties supplying such information may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, and other sources of market information.  The non-defaulting party shall aggregate such Gains, Losses and Costs with respect to all Transactions into a single net amount and notify the Defaulting Party of the net amount owed or owing (the "\plain\f2\fs20\ul Termination Payment\plain\f2\fs20 ").  If the non-defaulting party's aggregate Losses and Costs exceed its aggregate Gains, the Defaulting Party shall, within five Business Days of receipt of such notice, pay the Termination Payment to the non-defaulting party, which Termination Payment shall accrue interest at the Interest Rate from the Early Termination Date until paid.  If the non-defaulting party's aggregate Gains exceed its Losses and Costs resulting from the Event of Default, subject to the rights of setoff set forth in \plain\f2\fs20\ul Section 5\plain\f2\fs20 , the non-defaulting party shall pay the Termination Payment to the Defaulting Party within five Business Days of such determination.  \par

Except with respect to payment obligations, in the event either party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under a Transaction, it is agreed that upon such party's giving notice of such Force Majeure to the other party as soon as reasonably possible (to be confirmed in writing), the obligations of such party, to the extent they are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and during the continuance of the Force Majeure.  The cause of the Force Majeure shall be remedied with all reasonable dispatch by the party claiming same (the "\plain\f2\fs20\ul Claiming Party\plain\f2\fs20 ").  No provision herein shall require or permit either party to schedule gas in excess of the Daily Contract Quantity or at points other than the Delivery Point(s).  The party claiming Force Majeure shall provide the non-claiming party notice of the Claiming Party's best estimate of the duration of the Force Majeure (the "\plain\f2\fs20\ul Estimated Duration\plain\f2\fs20 ").  During the Estimated Duration, the non-claiming party shall not be required to resume its obligations to the Claiming Party with respect to the part of the Transaction that the Claiming Party has claimed is subject to Force Majeure.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as all or part of the Force Majeure ceases, the Claiming Party shall notify the non-claiming party who shall have the option to require the Claiming Party to resume all or part of its obligations under the Transaction prior to the expiration of the Estimated Duration; in all events the parties shall resume their obligations under the Transaction upon the expiration of the Estimated Duration with respect to all or that part of the Transaction that is no longer subject to the Force Majeure.  If all or part of the Force Majeure continues to exist beyond the Estimated Duration, then the non-claiming party may take any action it deems commercially reasonable under the circumstances.  Notwithstanding the foregoing Force Majeure provisions, should the Force Majeure continue for greater than a period of 60 days from its inception, the non-claiming party may at its election, prior to the Force Majeure having been remedied by the Claiming Party and written notice of such remedy having been received by the non-claiming party from the Claiming Party, designate an Early Termination Date in accordance with the provisions of \plain\f2\fs20\ul Section 3\plain\f2\fs20  applicable only to the Transaction, or part thereof subject to the Force Majeure, and the non-claiming party shall determine the Termination Payment applicable to the Transaction, or applicable part thereof, and the parties shall make payment of the Termination Payment each in accordance with \plain\f2\fs20\ul Section 3\plain\f2\fs20 .   \par

The obligations of Y and X under this GTC in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X\rquote s Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this \plain\f2\fs20\ul Section 5\plain\f2\fs20  as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this \plain\f2\fs20\ul Section 5\plain\f2\fs20  may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.
