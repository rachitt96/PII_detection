Hunter:  John called Chris Williams today asking what was happening, so I 
returned his call and told him that I would check.  He interviewed with you 
and your group on 8/22/2000, and it appears that John may have been a 
candidate for your 4:00 am analyst position.   From our conversation today, I 
would guess that he was too experienced (and,thus,too expensive), but I don't 
know if there is yet another position I am not aware of.    Would you give me 
an update on his status so that I can call him back?

Thanks,
Molly
