Title: Bouncing Above Oil
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2356


NATURAL GAS PRICES WILL BE SUSTAINED ABOVE $5.00

This spring and summer will present a major challenge to natural gas 
markets--refilling storage inventories while meeting underlying growth from 
power
demand. Achieving these goals will require some demand to be held off of the
market, which will in turn require gas prices to remain above those of
distillate fuel oil.

* CERA expects April to have the strongest injections since 1998.

* Gas prices will remain close to those of distillate through the end of
May.

* Prices will be volatile, as the market is still in a precarious
situation.
