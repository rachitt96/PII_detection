Subject: Enron Transport Capacity Projects - Kickoff Meeting

Most of you are aware that there are several projects on the table dealing 
with Gas Transportation Capacity information.  On Monday, the 25th,  Russell 
Long a Business Analyst with over 15 years of business and IT experience will 
be joining Enron and will be assigned to help get these projects jump started 
and provide coordination across the projects.  I'd like to get together on 
Tuesday the 26th to present and discuss the following:

High Level Combined Project Plan
Overall Project Coordination & Documentation
Individual Project Leads and Team Members
Major Issues and Questions

It is probably not critical that everyone be able to attend as I can follow 
follow up later with those that can't make the meeting and I want to get 
started ASAP.  In the mean time feel free to contact me if you have any 
questions.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Cheryl:  Please set up the meeting referenced above and invite the people 
address on this memo.  At a minimum I'd like to have Hunter, Colleen, Bhavna, 
Colin, Scott, Dave, Chris Gaskill, Chris Hanz and Cade at the meeting.  I'd 
like to meet on Tuesday the 26th if possible.  Thanks!
