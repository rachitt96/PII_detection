Message Body :Hunter, I spoke with Heather Purcell who is kind of like the intermediate between IT and business in terms of web based commodity information. Basically I informed her that CF was now being released to the gas trader/originators and showed her the message board features for each commodity (have a look on the site .. very cool). 

Anyway, when I proposed to her that it would be in her interest to encourage her users to use CF, and that it will not allow a single point of reference for weather information etc. I experienced immediate resistance. Heather basically informed me that her boss, Shankman would not be using the site because it did not contain the power information!! My response was why not use the site at least to facilitate the communication between crude + gas in the mean-time, basically integral markets.

... anyway, I think the basic problem is that Heather et al  have spent a great deal of time + money on the design of all 10 or so EGM sites (prob over 100k), and now her is one site that does it all and more !!! 

I know you realize the issues, but for this to be a completely effect tool for the traders, we really need buy in from EGM. I appreciate Heather's resistance, however you can't stop progress.

What do you think ??
