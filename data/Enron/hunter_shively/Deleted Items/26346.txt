Message Body :Fred,
I will be in Houston Wednesday and Thursday this week and would like to set a time to discuss Peoples.  Until then, will you please discontinue all communication with Judy Pokorny and all subsidiaries of Peoples.  This is in line with the brief conversation we had last week.  Judy took this information directly to the President of Peoples, Tom Patrick and he discussed it with me at a 2:30pm meeting today.

Regards,

Laura Luce

Judy forwarded an "Enron Market Outlook" to PGL MGMT from Freddy-boy.  Is she trying to make us look bad?  Why is Fred going after this business?
