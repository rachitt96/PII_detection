"ADVISORY"
 January 10, 2002

Nicor Gas has realized over the past days-warmer weather, lower sendout volumes and lower than anticipated storage withdrawals.  Currently the weather forecast into the weekend would continue this lower sendout volume trend.  Nicor Gas is advising shippers that it may be forced to limit specific pipeline receipts in order to manage storage activities.

We ask that shippers do not increase total nominations to our gate. 

In addition, Nicor Gas advises shippers to limit pipeline nominations into our systems, specifically receipts from the following pipelines, Alliance, ANR and Northern Border.  If shippers voluntarily limit nominations on these pipelines through and including gas day Monday January 14, 2002 no further action will be anticipated. 

We are providing this notice so that its shippers will be prepared to make arrangements with other pipelines.
