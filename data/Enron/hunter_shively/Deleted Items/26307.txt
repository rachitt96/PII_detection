Message Body :Hey Guys,
I probably will need one more spot.  We have been talking about moving Cora into a little different position so that she can handle the Peoples and Chicago office activity.  This means that I will need another scheduler to replace her.  Hunter/Laura do you want Cora with the traders or with the schedulers?  I have told Rain already and have put the spot with the schedulers.  Let me know if you need something different.
Lisa
