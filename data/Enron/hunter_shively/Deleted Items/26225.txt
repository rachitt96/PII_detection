  New AvantGo User Survey
**************************
Hello huntshiv,
We were hoping that you could take a few minutes to fill out 
a short survey for us. This is your chance to help 
shape the future of AvantGo!
Understanding the interests and activities of our users helps 
us make sure that we create the best business partnerships 
that bring the most useful content and applications to you 
and our other users.
Completing the survey should take less than 5 minutes. There 
are only 9 questions--you already know the answers.
        
Click here to fill out the survey:http://kc-tr.avantgo.com/kc1231906901.1150.0.1110 And, don't worry, the information you supply is confidential 
and will be used only for research purposes. Information will 
not be attributed to individual respondents, and your
