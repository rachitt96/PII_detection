Message Body :Hey Hunter,

Okay here are the Secrets I have learned from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator:  You have any more?

Real money is made on understanding market trends not individual fluctuations
Understand the power of large market participants.  Try to achieve their power. 
Never Buy on a Tipster
If something is wrong and you don't know why get out
Understand  your physiological and psychological gut for a stock
