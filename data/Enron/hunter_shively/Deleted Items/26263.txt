Got a question about Enron or what our businesses are doing?  Ask Jeff Skilling!  Join him for an Office of the Chairman "open mike" session today (May 30) on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.
Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Jeff will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.
