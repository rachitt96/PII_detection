Message Body :Hey Hunter, 
FYI - I will be out this afternoon for our PRC meeting.  And tomorrow Cora and I leave for Chicago- we will be there all day Wednesday and come back on Thursday.  We are flying up there so that we can work on the set up for the Allegehny and Constellation Power Plants.  I am going to leave at noon tomorrow so that I can order appliances for my kitchen before I need to be at the airport.  Mark will attend the afternoon meetings to keep you up to date on any logistics issues. 

One more thing - this weekend they are going to migrate Unify to the new sequel server platform.  They are going to take Unify down at 2:00pm on Friday to start the process -so any assistance on Friday morning in finishing early would be appreciated.  We will need to get all the weekend noms done before it goes down.  Unify should be up and running Saturday morning - we will be in here testing Sat morn to make sure that it is performing o.k. so that Monday will go smoothly.
Thanks
Lisa
