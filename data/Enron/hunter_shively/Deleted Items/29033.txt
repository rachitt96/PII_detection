Message Body :
	We have to unfortunately discontinue our live weather webpage from the website.  The feed we were receiving from Clayton Vernon
is no longer available and we currently don't have the resources to develop a new solution based of the NOA feed from Ardmore.

We'll be removing from the website in the interim.


Thanks,

Dave
