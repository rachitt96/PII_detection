I realize two is a party and three a crowd, but would you be okay with me "crashing" your meetings with Penman.  People's is unable to meet on Friday and has asked to postpone until Monday.  If I can still met with you and Penman and be part of the process, I rather not reschedule, and keep my current plans.  However, if you believe I would not add value, I can easily reschedule for next week.

PS.  If I keep my current agenda, I would arrange a trip later in the summer and visit with Judy via telephone.
