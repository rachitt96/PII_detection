Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Late Spring Break
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2392



Year-over-year storage numbers have benefited from record April injections. Continued fuel switching, a weakened economy, and favorable weather have contributed to a softening market, so that natural gas has been pricing below distillate. It is still too early, however, to declare summer over, and CERA believes that prices will remain high enough to keep end users off gas.

* Under normal weather, April injections have put inventories on pace to reach 2,820 Bcf by the end of October, 121 Bcf above last October.

* As summer power demand ramps up, CERA expects prices to move upward in June, averaging $4.90 for the month.

* The market remains vulnerable to price volatility, as summer power load increases could cause significant price run-ups.
