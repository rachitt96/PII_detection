Message Body :Group...
Well the move to Netco begins.  I would like to schedule a meeting for Wednesday, January 2nd at 10:00 a.m. to discuss the below and map out our plan of action.  As I am sure you are aware, this is our course to set, so let's think outside the framework on the most effective way to start a new company.
 
I am following e-mail from home.  If you have thoughts/concerns/questions prior to the meeting, let me know.
 
Happy New Year to everyone!
 
Laura

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.
