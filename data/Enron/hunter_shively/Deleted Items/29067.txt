ADVISORY
January 21, 2002

Nicor Gas is anticipating warming weather trends throughout the remainder of the week and into the weekend.  This weather pattern will lower sendout volumes.  Nicor Gas is advising shippers it may be forced to limit specific pipeline receipts in order to manage storage activities.

We ask that shippers do not increase total nominations to our gate.

We are providing this notice so those shippers will be prepared to make arrangements in the event further action is required.
