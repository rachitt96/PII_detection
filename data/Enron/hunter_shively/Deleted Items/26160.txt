.........Frank and I are in Chicago on business.  

It's Monday morning and I'm sitting in the office waiting for Frank to get here when all of a sudden 50 people of the street come on to the trade floor with protest signs (a group called ACORN).  They are protesting the high natural gas prices and wanted us to fax a letter to Ken Lay condemning him for being a money hungry CEO.  
They were chanting and singing protest songs...............and had TV cameras with them.  All business had to be stopped for about half an hour.  It was funny cause they were saying things like...."look they all have palm pilots.......".   Well the COPS showed up and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave...............
It was really funny in a way but, also makes one think about the kind of misdirected information that people are fed by the media.....
So that's the protest story from Chicago.......

Thanks
