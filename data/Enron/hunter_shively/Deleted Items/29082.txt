Message Body :John,

This is my view on what may be possible:

Steve:	Issues:	1. Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business
		2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him
		3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.
		4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.

	Solution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:
		   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group
		   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%
		   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.

Adam:	Issue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)

	Solution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!
		   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is
		   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,
		   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.

Jose:	Issue:	1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR
		    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, "Mike had to fight way to hard
		    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1.")

	Solution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.  I think the ONLY hope would be for him to regain trust and respect for senior management. Senior
		   management would need to sitt with him and LISTEN to his issues!!!!

Mike:	Issues:   1. He wants out!!!!!!!!!!
