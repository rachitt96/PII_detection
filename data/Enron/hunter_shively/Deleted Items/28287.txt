Subject : PLEASE RESPOND BY NOON FRIDAY -- ENA Comments, NOPR on Intraday Recall Rights

Message Body :Attached are comments which ENA proposes to file in response to FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking establishing the right for releasing shippers to recall released capacity from the replacement shipper for nomination at each of the first three GISB prescribed nomination deadlines.  The comments support the NOPR except that we say the FERC should make it absolutely clear that the intraday recall right must be part of a specific and express agreement between the releasing and replacement shipper, and that FERC should schedule a workshop after issuing the order so that operational concerns, such as accounting and gas tracking issues, can be worked out.

Comments must be filed by Monday, so please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions by noon CST on Friday, 11/16.  Thanks.
