Message Body :Bob,

I talked with Hunter about the west logistics organizational chart.  We came up with the following list, which I believe matches your recommendation.

Randy Gay
Patti Sullivan
Shelly Mendel
Suzanne Christiansen
Shannon Groenewold


If we were to enter a scenario that reduced the analyst level on my desk, I would recommend that we discuss the placement of Susan Scott and/or Jason Wolfe in west logistics.  They have both performed at high level in logistics and offer the new company a longer term skill set than a few of the people listed in our west logistics org chart.

Please let me know what your thoughts are regarding the unfortunate scenario mentioned above.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby
