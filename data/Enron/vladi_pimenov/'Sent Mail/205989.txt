WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Tuesday he planned to nominate three top businessmen to the civilian positions of Army, Navy and Air Force secretary at the Pentagon. 

Bush chose James Roche, corporate vice president and president of the Electronic Sensors and Systems Sector of the Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC), to be secretary of the Air Force. 

Before joining the private sector, Roche served as Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee and as principal deputy director of policy planning at the State Department. 

Thomas White, Bush's choice for Army secretary, is currently vice chairman of Enron Energy Services (ENE). 
He served in the Army for 23 years, retiring as a brigadier general and was executive assistant to the current Secretary of State Colin Powell
 when Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Bush also said he intended to nominate Gordon England to be secretary of the Navy. 
England is currently executive vice president of General Dynamics (GD), where he has worked for 17 years. 

All three nominees must be confirmed by the Senate. ((Washington newsroom 202 898-8300, fax 202 898 8383, email Washington.bureau.newsroom@reuters.com))
