Natalie:  this is not true, you would have to extend your HIB visa in order to continue working in the US.  I do it all the time for our employees.

Margaret,

Thank you for your reply yesterday.

I heard rumors that once you apply for green card you can't extend your H1B visa status (for another 3 years). Please, tell me if it is true.

Thank you,
Natalie
