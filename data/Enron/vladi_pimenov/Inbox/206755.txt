Due to desktop space constraints in the new Enron Center South facility, AMTEL equipment will not moved. The replacement for communications will be MSN Messenger. MSN Messenger will allow you to directly communicate with the person you are trying to reach. It will also alert you to their status (Busy, Away, On the Phone, Out to Lunch, etc.). The installation and configuration for MSN Messenger is simple. Please follow the steps listed below carefully to ensure a smooth installation.
 
To install MSN Messenger, first go to the Start Menu -> Programs -> System Utility Applications -> MSN Messenger icon. While navigating to the icon it may be necessary to pull down a "double chevron" if you don't see the folders specified above.
 

 
 
This will launch the setup for MSN Messenger. It should only take a few seconds. The configuration is very simple.
 
 

 
Follow the prompts closely to ensure a smooth setup.
 
On the first screen, titled Welcome to MSN Messenger Service!, click Next ->
 

 
Type in your standard enron.com email address. The format is firstname.lastname@enron.com <mailto:firstname.lastname@enron.com>. Please be sure that "Use this program to talk to my Microsoft Exchange contacts" box is checked. Click Next -> to continue.
 

 
Check the box labeled "Use Exchange Instant Messaging only. (Do not connect to the Internet.)
Click Next -> to continue. Click the Finish button to complete the MSN Messenger setup.
 
After completing the setup wizard, you should be able to sign into the MSN Messenger Service. Click the blue text to sign in

Click the "OK" button. If the connection is successful, you should be able to see a contact list. This is where you can view your contacts status and start communications.
