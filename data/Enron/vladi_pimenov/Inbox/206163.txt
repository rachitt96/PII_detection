Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive 
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of 
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective 
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional 
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent 
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to 
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further 
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its 
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently 
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers 
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to 
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits 
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may 
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies 
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.
