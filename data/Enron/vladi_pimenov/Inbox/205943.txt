Happy Holidays!

Many of us may not be feeling all that cheerful these days and may not even realize that it is the holiday season. So I decided it's time to celebrate and spread a little Christmas cheer. What better way to kick off the holiday season and forget about your worries than with good friends. So come spread good cheer or just drown your sorrows if you wish, but come. Bring your wives, husbands, etc. and your favorite holiday beverage. 

Oh, and I don't want any excuses about some football game that may be on TV.
