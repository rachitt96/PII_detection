I just found something suprising.

The starting date for settled price data for invidual curves may differ.  

For Example  -- Using an effective date of 1/1/01 price data for the following curves begins on: 
GDP-AECO  		4-1-01
GDP-AECO-ENRON 	2-1-01
GDP-AQUADULCE 	1-1-01
GDP-ALGONQUIN 	1-1-01

To get the data to align propely a prompt month of 4/1/01 can be used.

The earlier sheet doesn't alert you to and simply outputs the pricedata without regard to the date of the 1st available price.  The attached sheet displays the first date pricing is available (after the prompt month) if it doesn't match the prompt month.

Thanks,
Kim
