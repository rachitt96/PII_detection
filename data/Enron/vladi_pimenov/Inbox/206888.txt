Message Body :
All,

As you have some visa condition associated to your employment with UBS, we will shortly be forwarding to you an assignment letter that allows you to provide services to UBS whilst still an employee of Enron.   This assignment letter will only be applicable until your visa is approved by the INS.     Therefore, if any of you will be out of the office this week/early next week, can you please let me know.

Kind regards,

Karen
