PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

路	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
路	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
路	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
路	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.
