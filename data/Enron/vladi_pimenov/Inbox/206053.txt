Subject : Cancellation of Transco Z6 NY deliveries, Dec 2001

Message Body :Vladi,  as per our discussion today, Sprague and Enron are canceling our
deal to buy 6,000 Dth Transco Z6 NY for 12/4-31/01 (Sprague buying from
Enron). Due to Enron's inability to deliver physical gas, Sprague will
purchase supply from alternate suppliers.  You and I netted out physical
deliveries for 12/1-3.

We will notify downstream LDC's not to accept any gas from Enron for us. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank you.
