Subject : New curve fetch file

Message Body :
Due to the change of servers and moving of all ERMS  databases to the new locations old curve fetch files are not working properly.

I got our IT guys to fix the file you gave me. Everything looks OK now.

I got the new file attached.

Let me know if you have any questions.
