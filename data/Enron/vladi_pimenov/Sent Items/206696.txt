I am coming in this weekend to box up for the big move........ Please go through the large black file cabinet and the beige and purge, anything you don't want.  There will be dumpsters along the floor tomorrow afternoon.  I have your move packets and I will issue them later next week.  There is a 6 Box MAXIMUM......    If you have more than that, the movers will only move 6 boxes.  There will be 2 sets of drawers.  If you have any other questions, please ask me.
