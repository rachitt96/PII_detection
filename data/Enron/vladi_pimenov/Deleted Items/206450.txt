Message Body :
Volunteer Opportunity to become involved in the community and meet professionals throughout Houston 

Become involved in the community and see how you can help change the face of Houston at a meeting hosting the Quality of Life Coalition.  The Quality of Life Coalition is a part of the Gulf Coast Institute, a prominent non-for-profit entity that is engaged in making Houston a better place to live by developing and promoting recreational and environmental amenities (such as running and biking trails like the greenbelt for you Austinites!) that appeal to all parts of the community.  The group is a mixture of local citizens from the civic improvement, business, and environmental communities who would like to improve the fundamental health and economics of the city to be more competitive with other cities.  At the meeting, the president will more specifically discuss the plan for Houston as well as volunteer opportunities for interested and experienced professionals.  

The meeting is:
Tuesday, October 16th
11:30 in 27c2
