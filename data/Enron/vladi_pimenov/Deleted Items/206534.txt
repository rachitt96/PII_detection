Texas Eastern Transmission (TE)will have limited ability to absorb due-
shipper gas into the system this weekend.  Effective gas day Saturday,
October 13, 2001, TE is requesting that all shippers ensure that
physical receipts do not exceed physical deliveries. No due-pipeline
makeup gas may be scheduled, and OBA parties should ensure that physical
takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas may be
scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.  These restrictions
are expected to be in effect through Sunday, October 14, 2001.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
