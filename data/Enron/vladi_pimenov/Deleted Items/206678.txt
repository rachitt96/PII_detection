It has been determined that the data reported in the Flowing
Gas/Measurement/Hourly Quantity by Meter report on Columbia's Navigator system
may be misstated due to the recent time change.

This situation may impact the 1 AM, 2 AM, and 3 AM hourly gas flows that are
part of the Saturday, October 27, 2001 gas day.  Gas Measurement is aware of
the situation and will notify customers when the issue has been resolved.

Thank you for your patience.
