New Power Products on ICE!!

On Friday, October 26 IntercontinentalExchange will launch Hourly Power as well as 2nd, 3rd, 4th Week strips.  The Hourly Power will be offered for all the West Power hubs and for PJM in the East.  These new markets will have to be manually added to portfolios.  The 2nd, 3rd, 4th Week strips will be available for all Power hubs currently available on the Exchange and will be automatically added to portfolios containing the Next Day strip for a particular hub.

Credit must be set under the Financial Power credit filter for the PJM Hourly and under the Power credit filter for the West Hourly markets.  Hourly Power markets can be arranged in chronological order in the Portfolio Editor window.  Please call your ICE representative if assistance is needed.

Any other questions or concerns should be directed to our 24 hour Help Desk at  770-738-2101.
