sorry for sending this again.....


										


It has been a while, and understandably so, since our jovial crowd has gathered for one of its notorious celebrations :-(.....

This one witch in particular, hovering above our lonely planet, hasn't been that pleased with the sightseeing of late.... but something is now catching her attention down by 2049 Westcreek Lane...

Its a premature Halloween PARTY to celebrate our three old B-day ghosts...
							 Juan, Samar, & Luis!!!!!!!!!

Join us, on Saturday October 13th at the 2nd floor of the Westcreek Apartments Clubhouse (2049 Westcreek Lane) for a glorious event in the name of friendship and global harmony!!!


8pm til the "spirits" take us away....

Costumes are welcome
Bring many many friends....
Scary spirits (of the liquid kind) are obviously welcome :-)
