Gas Structuring is starting its "Clean Sweep" process today at 3:00 PM on the 32nd floor.  Clean Sweep is the process that the move coordinators have instituted to eliminate unnecessary storage of outdated material in the new building.  So, Gas Structuring will close for business effective 3:00 PM today and reopen tomorrow morning.  If you or anyone on your team have an urgent matter that has to be addressed today, please make every effort to get to us in time for us to respond before 3:00 PM.  Also, please forward this notice to the persons on your respective teams.  If you have any questions, please ask.  
Thanks,
Ed

PS  The move "regulators" are reported to be providing refreshments and snacks for this event.  As such, we are seeking proposals to "pass through" these "incentives" to any person or persons who would like to "outsource" our sweep process.  Proposals will be accepted up until 12:00 PM today.  We reserve to right to accept all or any part of  any proposal and may or may not negotiate with one or more parties to provide the sweep service.  All sweep outsourcing proposals are subject to move regulator approval.  Any change in move regulation that results in a reduction in incentives being enjoyed by Gas Structuring will require that the outsourcing party keep Gas Structuring whole.  Baseball arbitration for all disputes.  This agreement will be governed by Texas Law and we will give the successful outsourcing party(ies) our contract to sign immediately prior to work commencing.  No changes to the contract will be allowed since the move regulators have already approved the agreement.  We will answer no questions regarding the size or number of files to be swept.  You must obtain any information regarding the size or number of files, type or quantity or refreshments, type and quantity of snacks and other such data from public sources.  We will accept cash above all other forms of consideration.
