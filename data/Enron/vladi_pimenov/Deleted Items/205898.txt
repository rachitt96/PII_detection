Subject : Stack Manager Changes

Message Body :On Friday night, we plan to make some changes to Stack Manager, which should be effective by Saturday morning. These changes are:

	1) Order Sweep functionality
	2) Removal of Enron references and logos

The Order Sweep allows you to fill the order you right-click on, plus all of the orders above it. Until this release, fill order functionality has been available only for the order at the top of your stack. Note that it will still not be possible to fill any individual order below the top of the order stack unless you also fill the orders above it (i.e. no "picking off" orders).

Be careful. Right - clicking on an order stack will fill not only the order at the top of the stack, but all orders from the top down to and including the one you click on (This is an "order sweep").

If we experience any difficulties with this release on Friday night, the release may be "rolled back" to the old version. You will be able to tell if this release has been rolled back by the logo which appears on the Stack Manager.

Dave
