Re:  Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp ACA Filing

On August 31, 2001 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line 
Corporation (Transco) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket 
No. RP01-540-000 to reflect a decrease in its Annual Charge 
Adjustment (ACA) from $0.0022 to $0.0021 per Dth.  The 
Commission issued a letter order dated September 26, 2001 
accepting Transco's filing effective October 1, 2001.

Please refer any questions to Mike Heeney, Rate Department,
