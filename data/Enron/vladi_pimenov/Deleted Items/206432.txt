* THE DONKEY SHOW @ TONIC *
I want to explain to all the people asking questions regarding what's the
Donkey Show? Why is it called The Donkey Show? Are you having a live donkey?

Well if you want to bring a donkey or dress up as one, be my guest!
The Donkey Show is a concept taken from a party Studio 54 use to throw back
in the day (70's that is) where they re-enacted Shakespeare's "A Midsummer's
Nights Dream" all pimped out in 70's style and it was the party to be at!
Tonic-Tryst would like to continue the tradition with a third straight year
celebrating disco fever and donkey love! So please come dressed up as
whatever you want to be and have a great time!
Don't forget drinks are free 8-10pm courtesy of Jaysen Clark!
