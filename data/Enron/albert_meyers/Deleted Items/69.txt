Message Body :Mike and Bill:

Just wanted to let you guys know that Excel crashed during the evening around 8:00 pm.  While it didn't erase anything i had already saved...i was forced to stay around for an extra 3 hours to re-enter the data i had previously entered.  I don't know what the problem is but just thought i would let you guys know what happened so you could do some research and we can get this problem fixed.

regards,

bert meyers
