Subject : Frontier Unit Outage for 07/21/01

Message Body :Frontier was forced to bring their unit down as they had an ash problem and needed to do some work on their generator.  Starting @ 7:40 Frontier was producing 4MW instead of the pre-schedule 8MW.  We picked up some operating reserves for the remainder of HE 08 and for all of HE 09.  Since the schedule was sold unit contingent, I cut the schedule to a 4MW starting HE 10 till further.  Bonnie @ EWEB agreed to this curtailment.  The tag number for this deal is 27456.  If you have any questions please call me.

Regards,

Bert Meyers
