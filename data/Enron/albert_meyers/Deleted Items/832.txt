Subject : UBS Paperwork - ACTION REQ'D

Message Body :I just heard from Chris Lue, UBS HR, regarding the UBS New Hire paperwork.  All New Hire paperwork must be completed before 3:00 PM TODAY, Friday, 1/25/02 or UBS will be unable to process your payroll.  

These forms were distributed during the HR Benefit meetings held yesterday.  If you were unable to attend these meetings and are unsure about what forms need to be completed, please see either Grace or I ASAP.

Thanks!
