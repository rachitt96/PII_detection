Message Body :Donald,

Ralph from the Alberta Power Pool called to review tag #22872.  He is wondering if this tag should run both this sunday and the next sunday.  If you could please check it out when you have some time on Monday for the following week he would certainly appreciate it.  If there is no problem with the tag then he said not to bother.  The main issue is that the schedule will flow for this weekend.  

Any questions please give me a call.

Regards,

Bert Meyers
