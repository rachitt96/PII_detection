Message Body :Roger:

From the information that I was able to gather regarding power delivery for Sunday and Monday, December 9th and 10th, it appears as though we were able to schedule and deliver 6mw around the clock for Sunday and 6mw off-peak and 4mw on-peak for Monday.  The E-tags I referenced are as follows:

Tag 39501:  4mw around the clock Sunday and Monday

Tag 39499:  2mw around the clock Sunday

Tag 39500:  2mw Off-Peak Monday

If you have any question please contact myself, John, or Andrea Woodland

Regards,

Bert Meyers
