Message Body :Hey Bert,

I'm sure you knew that the Clintons were total dirtbags, but Hillary may have hit a new low.  Apparently, Hillary said that Chelsea was endangered by the attack.  But Chelsea gave a contradictory interview, saying that she watched the attack from a friend's apartment.

Later,

David.

Though, as usual, the elite media ignores it, some (Drudge, Wash Times, NY Post, Fox) are highlighting the contradiction in stories between Hillary and Chelsea as to Chelsea's 9/11 experience. Just after 9/11, Hillary told Jane Pauley that Chelsea "had gone on what she thought would be a great jog. She was going down to the Battery Park; she was going to go around the towers. She went to get a cup of coffee and - that's when the plane hit." Hillary said Chelsea heard the plane hit the WTC and saw the smoke in person. However, Chelsea penned a piece for Talk magazine that stated, "On the morning it happened I was at my friend Nicole Davison's apartment, near Union Square in Manhattan. That morning we had gotten up and grabbed coffee, and then she took the subway to work while I bought a paper and headed back to her apartment. I had just walked in when she called from work. A plane had just crashed into the World Trade Center, she said. I should stay put and she'd call me back when she knew more. I turned on the television and watched as the second plane hit." Chelsea writes she "spent the nightmarish day of the Twin Towers attacks in complete mental chaos -- roaming the city, obsessing over" W's tax cut while singing Humpty Dumpty to herself. Where did she learn how to personalize national tragedy and inject partisan politics at the same time?
