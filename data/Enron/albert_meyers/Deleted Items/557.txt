Message Body :Bert, for some reason I can't find you in the system to get an expense ready for you.  
Can you log into Expensexms.com and add me as your admin?  Otherwise I won't be
able to create the report.  You will need your P# and your password.  Do you have that?
If not then call ISC 713-345-4727.  They should be able to help you.  Once you log on 
you will need to go to - My Info (upper right corner), then click on Concur Expense tab,
then Workflow, then add me as your Admin Assistant.  Got it?  

Hope this helps.  Let me know when you complete this and I will get your expense done.

Jill
