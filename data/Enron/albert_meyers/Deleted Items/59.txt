The Southwest OASIS website (for PNM, SRP, NEVP, EPE, SMUD, SPP, and LADWP transmission reservations) has given us a new login ID and password. Don Norman is no longer our site administrator; Les Rawson has taken that title. I registered us with two user names and passwords, which are as follows:

	Login: rxtime12
	Password: epmipower

	Login: kxsymes1
	Password: realtime

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this new procedure.

Thanks,
Kate
