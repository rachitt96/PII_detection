Message Body :TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Tag number 38616 was cut for he 06 on sunday.  The schedule was 25mw to the ciso @ mead sinking with MWD.  Calpine couldn't supply the energy so the schedule was cut to zero.  I made every attempt to resupply the power from NEVP, which was willing to sell me the power for $16.00, but Dawn @ the CISO would not let me resupply the schedule.  I thought this to be sort of wierd considering even WAPA was on board.  Please see me with any question.
