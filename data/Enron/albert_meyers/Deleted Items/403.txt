Subject : CLARIFICATION: Parking & Mass Transit Options

Message Body :Hello all!

We thought we would clarify the Parking & Mass Transit options:

1) Three options are available:

2WTC/Outside parking lots
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month

Tri-Met
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.

Daily Validations
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.

2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.

3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
Your HR Team

Subject:	Parking & Mass Transit Resolution

We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

If you have any questions, please let us know!
