Message Body :There is a day ahead schedule cut coming out of the ISO for 09/02/01.  Duke is exporting @ Mead 230 and selling to us where we are selling to NEVP Marketing for the sink.  The cut was for HE 24 only 50mw cut to 1mw.  Duke is going to resubmit the schedule on a real time issue.  The old tag was 31482.  I terminated this tag and Duke created a new tag to reflect the cut.  The new tag number is rt0902a.  If for some reason they get cut for he 24 you will need to make sure  they resupply the schedule from another source in the desert.--Bert Meyers
