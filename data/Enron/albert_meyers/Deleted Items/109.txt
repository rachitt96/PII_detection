Just wanted you to know that EPE lost one of the Turbines hour ending 18 @ about 17:30 or so...I tried to buy power from everyone but to almost no avail (exept 50mw @ 53.00 integrated to a 13mw 3/4 past the hour)...Furthermore, I cut IID to a 100mw from a 120mw which integrated to a 115mw (being as I kept the first 100 whole),

For HE 19 I was forced to cut one of a 25mw purchase from PNM @ $32.00 to a 13mw because our imports were over capacity.  I also bought back 50mw from IID for HE 20 @ $40.00.

Please see the note for more details or the model and ask me with any questions

Bert
