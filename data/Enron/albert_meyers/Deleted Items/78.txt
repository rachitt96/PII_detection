Message Body :TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ABOVE TAGS WERE CUT TO A ZERO BECAUSE OF AVISTA WWP TRANSMISSION NEEDING TO TAKE POWER FOR NATIVE LOAD.  (AT LEAST THIS IS WHAT FRANK @ AVISTA WWP TRANSMISSION SHARED WITH ME OVER THE PHONE)  IM NOT QUITE SURE EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT BY THIS TERM AS WAS NOT WILLING TO SHARE A LOT OF INFO WITH ME OVER THE PHONE.  I WAS ABLE HOWEVER TO RESUPPLY THE POWER MYSELF BY PURCHASING FROM CHUCK @ AVISTA WWP FOR $22.00.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE SCHEDULES WAS 25 MW CUT TO ZERO, AND THEN RESUPPLIED BY WWP.  

DUKE WAS SUPPLYING THE ENERGY TO ME, BUT I FILLED THE SCHEDULE MYSELF DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE WERE CUT IN THE HOUR IN THE NW AND TYPICALLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET ANYONE TO RESUPPLY IN THE HOUR IN THE NORTHWEST.  SHERI @ DUKE DIDN'T NOT WANT TO AGREE TO PAY FOR THE POWER BECAUSE SHE WASN'T SURE (AS WAS I) EXACTLY WHY AVISTA WWP "PIRATED" HER POWER WHICH WAS THEN SOLD TO US IN THE CHAIN OF MARKETERS.

SHERI WANTS TO BILL WWP LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR CUTTING THE SCHEDULE TO KEEP THE POWER FOR THEIR NATIVE LOAD WHEN WE ONLY PURCHASED TRANSMISSION.
