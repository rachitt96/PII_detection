As of HE2 this morning, our contract with MPC was ended. For the time being, we will no longer be balancing MPC's load.

Also, we can only purchase up to 100 mws from APS transmission. Please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 100 mws. But do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with APS in the Southwest. These should be the only congestion wheels that we run.

Also, please use PNM not AEP for any sleeving for EPE.

Thanks,
Bill
