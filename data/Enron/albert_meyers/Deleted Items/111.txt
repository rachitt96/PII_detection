Subject : Buying from TEP for EPE

Message Body :As per Fred's suggestion it is much better to buy from TEP at Springerville rather than PV.  It is less costly to bring it home.  The tag is much shorter but should be an easy modification from the one we usually use when we buy from TEP.  Also this causes fewer problems for both TEP and EPE dispatchers.

Thanks,

Ryan
