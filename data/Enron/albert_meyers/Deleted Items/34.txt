Courtney:

Thought you might like to know that there were numerous cuts last night and into the morning hours.  

They are as follows:

05/06/01
ISO cut import @ Four corners 9MW for HE 19 and Export @ Summit 9MW for HE 19.
The same schedule was cut for by 21MW for HE 21 thru 22.

For HE 23 the ISO cut a 21MW import @ PV and the corresponding export @ Summit.

For all these hours, the ISO kept our buy resale whole with NCPA SP15 to NP15.

PAC Cut tag 14987 PSCO_AEPMWE_EPMIWE_EPMEWE_AVWP00 25 MW for HE 19-24.  PSCO booked out with Avista Water Power (WWP)  05/06/01.


05/07/01
PAC was cutting tag 14988 PSCO_EPMI_MECOLB_AVSTWE_CHPD 25MW for HE 01.  PSCO booked out with Avista Energy Trading (CHPD) 05/07/01.

CISO cut schdule EPMI_CISO_5000 and EPMI_CISO_5001 by 1MW each at PV.  We resold the power to SRP for $5.00.  Not a great price but everyone in the SW was
getting cut at the same time.  The new deals in Enpower are as follows:  602984 and 602985.  If you have any questions please see cut note or lotus notes.

Also this morning the ISO was cutting and SC trade with NES1 in SP15 and dec'd load in PGE 1, 2, and 3.  Must be Path 15 Congestion.
