Message Body :To all: 

The proposed sale of HPL to American Electric Power (AEP) has been signed and 
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming 
months.  Over the next few days, I will be forwarding more details about the 
transition process.  These details will outline the employment opportunities 
and transfer process to AEP.   AEP is eager to complete these arrangements, 
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.

During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line 
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy 
needs of our customers.

Regards,
Brian
