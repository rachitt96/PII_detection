Message Body :Effective: We have a new system to prepare expense reports called:

Expense Reporting System:  XMS

In order for us (your assistants) to prepare your expense reports you will 
need
to log on the system and give us your permission.  I will provide you step by 
step
instructions to do so.  I will make it as easy as possible.  It is very 
important
that you do this otherwise we will not have access or permission.

                Log on to xms.enron.com and enter your logon ID and password.

password is ENRON)
