Subject: HPL Curtailment Plan

We are going to be reviewing the HPL curtailment plan, with the ultimate 
issue being how does HPL best structure its curtailment program to comply 
with regulatory requirements and to best suit HPL,s business purposes.  
Attached is a memo meant to provide a brief summary about what a curtailment 
plan is and some of  its ramifications.  We,ll be setting up a meeting soon  
to discuss the issues surrounding the curtailment regulations and their 
significance to HPL.  Certainly there will be critical legal, regulatory, 
commercial, operational, gas control, accounting, and even public relation 
issues to be considered in this deliberation.  Whatever the decision may be 
as to what to do, we must also determine how to find out relevant facts, 
establish the processes to be followed, and perform the necessary procedures 
to implement our action plan.
