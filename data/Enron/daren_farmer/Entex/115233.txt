Subject: Reliant Energy - Entex Transport Imbalance


Howard,
This memo is regarding the 91,297 MMBtu imbalance that was created in April 
of 1999 on 
transport contract #012-41991-02-004. The transport delivery off HPLC was 
shorted to keep
Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport 
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 
1999, but 91,297 MMBtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC 
Index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can 
clear this imbalance. We will
need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the 
purchase from ENA by 91,297 
MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant 
Energy - Entex allocation to 
make sure this happens.


Thanks,
Michael
