Message Body :Hey, Dwight.

Everything is going fine here.  Thanks for your message.  I'm feeling pretty 
confident with how things are going.  I have received very positive feedback 
from my manager and my employees.  I have learned much from you, especially 
related to communication:  recognizing the different types of people, 
different ways to communicate.  And, I appreciate the time you've spent with 
me.  However, I would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being.  
When I'm in need of some "managing expertise" in the future, I will give you 
a call.  

Again, thanks for working with me.

Daren
