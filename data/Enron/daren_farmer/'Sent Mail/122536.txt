mid month pricing for the first month. Thanks.

Darren:

 This is potential new volume for March , 2000:

 Counterparty  Meter   Volume   Mid Month Gas Daily?

 Cico Oil & Gas Co. TBA   2117 MMbtu per day Yes 


 This number is NOT in Vance's production estimate. This well is anticipated 
to come on the first week of March but earlier is possible.


 Please let me know if you need any additional information.
