Message Body :Mike, 

What is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago?  I had a few 
items on that list, but I can't remember the details now.  Since I don't deal 
with Unify as much as I used to, the only thing that I can remember is:

We need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for 
each meter.
