Message Body :Jackie and Stella, 

I need ya'll to get together and work out how to handle this at Stratton.  I 
know that we get the estimated volume from Exxon daily and I would think that 
this volume will need to be allocated among the different deals.  But, Exxon 
will not have them broken out.
