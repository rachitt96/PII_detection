Daren - Can you set up a deal for the Cilco withdrawal for Dec. 99 going 
forward?  I know a deal has never been set up for this but volume management 
wants a deal set up so they won't have to set up an accounting arrangement 
evey month.  Please let me know, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks.

Aimee
