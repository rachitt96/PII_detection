Subject : Tufco @ Lone Star Katy - July 24 and 30

Message Body :Please see the attached Tufco file for July.  The 2,500 under the Wagner 
Brown contract on the 24th has been zeroed out (no flow at LS Katy for that 
day).  This resulted in a change between contracts/deals on the 31st also.  
Let me know if you have any questions.
