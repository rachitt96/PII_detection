Message Body :Just a little explanation on what you're seeing.

 We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take 
excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each 
day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we 
can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within 
their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual 
doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points.

Robert,
There is a large variance between noms and flow at this meter.  Is everyone 
in the loop on this.  Pat
