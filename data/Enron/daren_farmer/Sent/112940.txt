Could you please correct the deal below.  Whenever you book a deal with PG&E 
we have to be careful as to which one.  DO NOT assume that is will be PG&E 
Energy Trading-Gas Corp.  More times than not, it is PG&E Texas Industrial 
for Texas.

Thanks!!

Julie

I remember that we discussed this issue once before, and you may have set the 
deal up already.  If so, just e-mail the details to me.  If the deal has not 
been set up, then please create the deal.

10/99  HPLC  PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corp. 100,000  $2.80 $280,000.00 125212 

The above deal should have been set up under PG&E Texas Industrial.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
