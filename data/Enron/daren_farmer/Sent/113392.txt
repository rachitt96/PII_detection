Message Body :The deal with Oxy Vinyls (#276478) will covers the volume for all of 
October.  We had zero in the system after the 6th because the plant was 
down.  The deal should have been nom'd at zero on these days.

Daren,

A sale to Oxy Vinyls went into effect 10/01 through 10/16 for 5,000 per day.  
We also delivered gas to Entex, 10,000/day for the entire month.  More gas 
was pulled towards the end of the month than confirmed and I need to know if 
Oxy Vinyls should get the swing for the remaining of the month even though 
their deal went to zero.  Please advise.

Susan
