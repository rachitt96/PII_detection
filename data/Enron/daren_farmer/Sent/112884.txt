Here are the issues for HL&P for 11/99:

The shortage at San Jac meter 1554 (the 95%) cannot be made up at 7268 
because not enough flow at the meters.  What can we do?  Buyback?
Adonis has nom of 10000mmbtu on day 4, should this be kept whole?   If so, 
how?  Day 4 flowed of 153mmbtu at the aggregate meter.

Please advice.  

Thanks
