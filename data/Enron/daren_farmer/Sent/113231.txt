Message Body :Esther, 

Gary asked me to send this info to you for the business trip that I've 
invited him on.

  Enron employees will be leaving at 11:30am on Continental flight #1668 from 
Bush Intercontinental on Friday 8/4/00.

The return flight from Tampa will be Continental #1663 leaving Tampa at 3:20 
pm on Sunday, arriving in Houston at 4:29pm.

I believe that there are a couple of later flights on Friday (around 1:30 and 
3:30) if Gary needs to come in for a part of the day.  I will probably have 
to catch one of the later ones, but Gary is welcome to go whenever he likes.

If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.

Daren
