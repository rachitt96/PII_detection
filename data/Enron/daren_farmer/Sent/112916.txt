Steve Weller's access should be removed.  He is no longer involved with the 
Texas Desk.  The rest need to retain their access.

Daren, you did not include the following people in your list of Texas 
Marketers.  Are they not trading on the Texas desk or do they still need the 
current trader access for the Texas desk?

Janet Wallis
George Weissman
Jennifer Sabine
Kenny Soigney
Steve Weller

Thanks for your help.
