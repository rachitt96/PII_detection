FYI

Daren---On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the Header system, for 
10,000........I think we were supplying it with AEC.  For whatever reason, I 
had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into Midcon...which isnt right because there was no 
market for it, and Midcon wasnt looking for it, but the Aquila deal was at 
#700 on WGR (Aquila).  So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match up 
with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.

Thanks,
Mark
