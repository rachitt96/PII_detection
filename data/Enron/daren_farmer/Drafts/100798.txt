Message Body :Les, 

I very much appreciate your invitation for the RFP for your requirements at Oasis Kerrville for the term of September 1,2001 until September 1, 2002.  We are interested in entering into long term transactions with our customers.  However, at this time, with the new orginization of our Texas Desk, I am unable to submit an offer for your RFP.  We are in the process of developing our desk, and in the near future, we will be able to offer competitive prices and firm deliveries to our customers.  I appreciate your business and hope that you will keep Enron in mind for your future gas requirements.  

Thanks.

Daren
