ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, Texas, in which , Enron has ownership interest.  Our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant.  This includes scheduling, invoicing, and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.  In addition to the daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.  Any profits/losses are passed on to Tenaska IV.  ENA is just paid a monthly fee.  Rick Hill is my contact person for the project. He is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel managment responsibility.  If he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to find some one with the Enron estate to handle this.  The problem with Enron continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no customers willing to trade with us).  So, the project is losing value.  Please give me a call when you get a chance.  Or, maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this.  My schedule is pretty flexible.
