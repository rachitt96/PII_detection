Subject: Best Church Web Sites and Best Practices


I have taken the assignment of gathering information about best practices
for church web sites for the Communications Task Force at Bammel.  I am
interested in hearing from each of you regarding your all-time favorite
church web sites.  These sites do not have to be published by churches of
Christ.

"Best practices" is a phrase that kept recurring in the first Task Force
meeting on Saturday, June 2.  This would seem to include:
"Essential" content (i.e.., maps, service times, etc.)
Privacy concerns (How do we provide great information without compromising
the privacy of our members?)
What sort of content would make Bammel stand out as a superior site?  (I am
not talking about look and feel, just information.)
Your own pet peeves about church web sites.  I figure that you are
representative of what others will think and probably more critical than
most.

Feel free to recruit opinions from other sources.  Send me links.  Express
yourself, but please respond as quickly as possible.  The time is very short
for gathering this information; it must be collected, analyzed and condensed
into notes for the elders by the end of June!  This means that I really need
to hear from you this week, if possible, and the sooner the better.

Thank you for your help in this effort.  Our hope is that we will dream
God-sized dreams so that He will be glorified.
