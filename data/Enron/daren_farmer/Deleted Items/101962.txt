Message Body :It's that time again to enter your hours and activities for May, 2001.  Please go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM Hours Survey\ProdUser_2000 (use ProdUser_97 if you have not converted to Windows 2000) in Access 2000 to access the hours survey.  Do not attempt to access the database links sent to you in the past because the file names have been changed and the link will not work.
