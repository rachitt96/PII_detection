Is current storage fill giving us 
a false sense of security? 
It's May. And those AGA storage numbers might have us feeling pretty secure about the future. But a lot can happen in a few short months. Consider these likely scenarios:
This summer hot or hotter than last summer? Predictions abound. 
Record number of new gas fired electric generation units on-line this summer, increasing demand and the draw on storage. 
Severe drought affecting hydropower, the lowest output in 30 years. 
Natural gas supply availability virtually unchanged from last year's levels.                        Fact or fiction?
