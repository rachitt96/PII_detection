For most  bugs, it's very short--sometimes just a few weeks. Lots of  butterflies, for example, live a month or two, but others live a  year or so. Some insects have a long juvenile stage and a brief  adulthood. One of the weirdest is the cicada. They spend maybe 13  years underground feeding on tree roots, then when they're the right  size and age, they crawl out of the ground, affix themselves to the  bark of trees, split out of their skin and emerge as an adult. In  the next two days, they mate and die. Imagine: 13 years of  childhood, one day of sex, then death.
