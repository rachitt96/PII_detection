[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]   Dear Daren,   December 27, 2001   [IMAGE] * WEEK  16 PREVIEWS  Get the latest injuries, stats and analysis of Week 16's matchups.  [IMAGE] Week  16 Game-by-Game Analysis     * NO  LION DOWN  When Matt Millen left the broadcast booth to take over as  president/CEO of the Lions, he never envisioned encountering as  much frustration and disappointment as he has over the past four  months. "It's the hardest thing I've done yet in football," a  candid Millen told NFL Insider's Vic Carucci in an exclusive  interview. "I'm as emotional as when I played, but there's nowhere  for it to go. It stays right in your chest."    * THE  CATCH OF A LIFETIME  In 1982, the 49ers got a gift that has lived on for nearly 20 years.  When Joe Montana found Dwight Clark in the end zone, it sparked a  dynasty that is still rolling today. Take a look back as NFL Insider  remembers the championship game that produced "The Catch."   [IMAGE] All-Time  Greatest Postseason Plays   [IMAGE] All-Time  Greatest Postseason Sequence     * STAT  PACK: KICKING IN THE CLUTCH  Placekickers have connected on 76.2 percent of their field-goal  attempts in the 2001 season. But in fourth-quarter and overtime  situations where the margin between the two teams is three points  or fewer, kickers have connected on just 70.4 percent of their attempts.  Those numbers demonstrate just how pressure can have an adverse effect  on even the best kickers. NFL.com's Andrew Mason breaks down all the  numbers.   * IN  A CLINCH  Find out which teams can clinch playoff bids in Week 16.   * LIVE  RADIO ON NFL.COM  Coverage begins Saturday afternoon with two games and picks up again  Sunday morning with live pre-game shows from across the country.
