"How can I afford to give away a Exelo Gelly- Carribean Blue ?"   Simply put, daren, I can't. At least not to everyone,  but you were smart enough to request free products from your-free-prize ,  so you're entitled!   But here's the catch! In the last few weeks folks have been ordering  this watch like crazy.   In fact, just before I sent this email my inventory quantities showed  only 37 left.  So I need you to click here  so I can ship yours before they're gone!   Do it now, and I guarantee you'll be one of the very lucky folks to receive  this terrific watch - FREE!   If you have any questions, daren, please feel  free to contact me. Thanks! [IMAGE] Lori Anderson Customer Service @ www.yourfreeprize.com
