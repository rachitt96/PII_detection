    Dear  Amazon Customer,  Dads are  simple, really. Pick out a gift meant just for us, and we're sure to love  it. (OK, excepting the ugly neckties. But the rest is great.) So this year,  skip the tie and check out our  Father's  Day Store --we've gathered lots of personal gifts sure to please Dad on  June 17.   Whether  Dad's a backyard griller or a workshop driller--or somewhere in between,  like me--you'll find unique gift ideas, custom recommendations, and even  some handsome gift-wrap for that final touch. Or for the Dad who has  everything, give the gift of choice--send him a  gift  certificate  through the mail or with a fun e-card.  Celebrate  Dad this June 17 and check out our  Father's  Day Store  today--if he wants it, we've probably got it, and we've made  it easy for you to find it and get it to him, too.  Sincerely,  [IMAGE]  David  Risher Senior VP and Proud Daddy of Two Amazon.com     [IMAGE]     Special  Offers   ?  Free  Shipping onElectronics Specials  ?  20%  to 40% off Books  ?
