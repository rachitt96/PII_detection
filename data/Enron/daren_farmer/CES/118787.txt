Ami,
Attached is the list of June availabilities for enron to sell.  I have listed 
the pipeline beside the offshore volumes and am in the process of doing the 
same for the onshore.  We are still waiting on a couple of volumes on some of 
the outside operated properties and have estimated availabilities for those 
properties.  Additionally, the PVR factors are estimated and will also be 
provided as they become available.

Please feel free to call me with any questions you have.

Thanks,
Steve
