Message Body :I was on vacation last week and Victor sent this out, but apparently not to 
everyone
who needed it.  Some of you have called looking for the numbers, so I'm 
sending it again.
 Please e-mail me and let me know if you do not  need this information.  
Steve at Devon told
me this morning that he is working on revisions this afternoon.

Thanks,
Beverly
