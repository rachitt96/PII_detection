Message Body :Daren,

Can you please verify for me whether we took over any old imbalances that CES 
had?  The reason I am asking if we got a letter from Kinder Morgan asking us 
to verify an imbalance.  It looks like it would of been an imbalance between 
CES and Kinder Morgan.  We don't show anything in our system and want to 
verify that we shouldn't.

Thanks and if I need to provide any further information, please let me know.

Karen
