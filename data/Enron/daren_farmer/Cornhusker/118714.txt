Message Body :Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi
