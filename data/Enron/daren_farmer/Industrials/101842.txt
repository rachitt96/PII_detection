Have you heard from Daren yet?  Equistar won't pay the invoice until we bill it correctly.  Thanks for you help.  I know it's bid week.

I sent this to Daren Farmer - to give me direction for the missing gas volumes. 
The deals went to '0' in Sitara by the Trader and Amiee confirmed it for the following days. Thanks - Julie
