Gary,

January 2001 nominations for gas delivery to Shell Deer Park are as follows:

Firm Baseload - 110,000 MMBtu/d
Spot Swing supply - 0 (zero)

Delivery of the above contract quantities is expected to be as follows:

  HPL-HP   HPL-E   HPL-S
 Firm 35,000 MMBtu/d 40,000 MMBtu/d 35,000 MMBtu/d

On or about January 7th we are currently planning on beginning our much
anticipated scheduled turnaround work. Natural gas demand is expected to
decrease with HPL's portion being 20,000 MMBtu/d coming primarily out of the
HP/E station. This will leave total demand at 90,000 MMBtu/d for the
remainder of the month.

Please let me know if you have any questions
