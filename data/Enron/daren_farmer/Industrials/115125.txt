Subject: Settelement Request for an Equistar "Buyback" ticket with ENA as 
Shipper


 
 Daren wanted me to make this request to you for an Equistar Buyback Ticket 
on Enron North America{ENA}.
 
 Equistar has nominated activity on ENA for June and July 2000 production.
 
 Settlement seems to think a Buyback ticket is necessary to properly account 
for Equistar's monthly activity.
