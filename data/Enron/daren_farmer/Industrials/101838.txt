See below - bad news - Mobil Beaumont volumes for early May will continue to be low .... I assume we will want to continue to deliver 30,000/d of MidCon volumes??  Let me know.

Lee,

Our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid May at the earliest.
This means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to
fuel.  We are nominating the minimum of 80 BBTU/D knowing that we should start
the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month
progresses and the Cold Box comes on line.  Call me if you have any questions.

Brian
