Lee,
Here are some specific situations I am trying to resolve regarding volume on 
Centana:

Purchase from Mobil:
2/99 - The purchase by HPLR for 155,000mms in deal 60978 was never billed by 
Mobil.  
 (A purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in 
sitara). 
  Per our conversation Friday, it sounds like HPLC does owe Mobil for his 
gas, right?


Sale to Mobil:
1/2000 - Per the pipe statement provided by Greg Bonin for Centana volumes, 
299,893 
 flowed in January.  I billed 299,893 and Mobil paid it.
 Logistics said 19,893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to Mobil 
because
 the gas wasn't scheduled.  In addition, if the 19,893 were a sale to Mobil, 
the 
 point would not be in balance in the system.  The source of 280,000 of the 
gas
 says they only sold 280,000mms and not any more. No other sources are in the 
system.
 
 I assume if the 19,893 wasn't consumed by Mobil, they wouldn't have 
 paid for it.   Is there storage involved here?  If so, whose storage and how 
did it work?


There are sales in other months with discrepancies on Centana with smaller 
volumes 
than in 1/2000.  Once I understand what happened in January, maybe that will 
help me
with the other months.

Please let me know if there is any other information you need from me 
relating to 
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this.  I 
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help.

Thanks,
Kris
