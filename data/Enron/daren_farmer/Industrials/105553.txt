 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Thanks
