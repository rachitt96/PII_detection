Message Body :
One year rate for this one will be $.35/mm for volumes greater than 300mm/day.  Price for volumes 300mm/day or less will be $.45/mm plus a $350 per month metering fee.  This rate would cover transport to a competitive Ship Channel market such as Equistar Channelview.  Transport rates for a 6 month term are not significantly different- $.33/mm for volumes greater than 300mm/day and $.42/mm plus the metering fee for volumes 300mm/day or less.  These rates assume a September 1, 2001 start.  These rates good until Friday, August 31, 2001 only!!!  Get 'em while they're hot!!
