That should leave in ENA ... Cleburne, Lonestar, Katy, Carthage and ENA IM Waha (there should be a ENA FT-Waha also).

This is the complete list of "Texas" business units.  Can I get an exact list of which ones should go to HPLC.
If a Firm book is not in their security, if they have a hedge with that book it will put the deal in pending until someone
with "Texas" access approves it.

Thanks

I am still waiting on the full list of all the business units that roll up under Texas.  However, the information I have received 
indicates that the HPLR desks are falling out under Texas.  The positions Ed Terry is looking at contain HPLR in the portfolio.
Should these be moved as well to HPLC.  If we remove Texas access to AEP, all the portfolios with HPLR will not be able
to be run by AEP.

Russ, please wait until after trading to move ENA - IM Texas to the HPLC desk.  We are concerned that it will affect our positions ... if not, then move it when you can.

Thanks.
