Team:

The attached provides a summary of our goals & objectives for 2000.  We have 
a number of challenges this year, but we making good progress building on our 
success in 1999.

The 2000 goals and objectives were developed as part of last year's budget 
process and were refined during our recent offsite.    A compilation of the 
presentations from the offsite were distributed to each of the VP's for 
discussion with their groups.  It will take continued effort from each of us 
to shift our source of earnings from monetizations to commercial 
origination.  As always, your ideas and active participation is encouraged.

Regards,
Brian
