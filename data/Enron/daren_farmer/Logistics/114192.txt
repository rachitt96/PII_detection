Tom,

See the attached file listing by trade zone by meter Producer Services' 
wellhead production estimate for the month of February, 2000.  PLEASE BE 
ADVISED THAT THIS IS A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE!!! as I am currently in the 
process of collecting noms from a couple of producers.  I will alert you of 
any revisions as they arise.  Additionally, I have highlighted those deals 
that we expect to come on in February, at such time will we request tickets 
to be entered into sitara.

Should you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,
