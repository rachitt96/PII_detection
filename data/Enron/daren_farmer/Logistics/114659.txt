Subject : HPL Buy/Sell Reports

Message Body :FYI.  I provided two reports to David Baumbach.  The reports were downloaded 
to Excel and saved to O:\Logistics\Buy_Sell_HPL_May_2000 and 
Buy_Sell_HPL_May_13_2000.  The first report reflects buys/sells by HPL across 
all pipes for the entire month of May.  The second report reflects buys/sells 
by HPL across all pipes for May 13, 2000, only.  Both reports were derived 
from the Volume Management module of UNIFY.  Please advise if you need 
additional information.
