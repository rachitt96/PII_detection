Message Body :FYI---


Please note that 7,305 of the Kinder Morgan sale was moved from Hardy (meter 
68) to Flagstaff (meter 1606) intraday on the 4th, and carried forward 
through the end of the month due to pressure problems.  This change was 
confirmed with Patsy Shimek @ Kinder Morgan.


Thanks,

Mark
