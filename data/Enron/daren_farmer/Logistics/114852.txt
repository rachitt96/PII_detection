Dave:

Thanks for your help, but I found it -- in Unify, it's T-C Oil.

According to Daren Farmer, this is the name.  Unify should have something for 
them.  If I find out anything different I'll let you know.

Dave:

This was flashed as O'Connor & Hewitt Ltd (233,343 mmbtu, $1,010,836.57), but 
I don't see anything coming through in Unify -- do you know if maybe they 
have another name?  

Thanks!
