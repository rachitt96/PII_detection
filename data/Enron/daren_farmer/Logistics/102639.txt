Good Morning Daren:
I received a fax from D&H for 06/01 deliveries (HPLC sales to D&H), however
there is no sales draft in Unify for this sale. Please advise if the 360
mmbtu reflected on D&H's 06/01 allocations, for HPL meter # 428-Deweyville.
Tx. a valid HPLC sale and if so, who do I contact about getting deal in
Sitara and scheduled for HPLC, so as to invoice D&H this month!


Thanks!
