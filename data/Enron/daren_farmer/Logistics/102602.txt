Subject : Entex delivery off of Oasis

Message Body :just a quick reminder that we need to cover the Entex delivery off of Oasis.

currently ENA has a transport agreement on Oasis.  This agreement will not be assigned.

Not use AEP has an agreement on Oasis.  Just to make sure, I would recommend we
sale the gas to AEP/HPL at the point for the month of June just to make sure the delivery
is made.

Let me know what you think.

thanks

bob
