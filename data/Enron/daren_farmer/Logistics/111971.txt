Here is my problem.  As you know, HPLC did a deal with Texas General Land Office where we would exchange gas for crude.  The problem was HPLC was selling the gas and Enron Gas Marketing was receiving the crude.  Bryce Baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between HPLC, ENA and EGM that would book the deal correctly.  Julie Meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed January and February, except for one small part, but March forward was never completed.  The attached word document explains the procedure.  Basically, we were suppose to book an HPLC sale to the TGLO with volume and zero price.  This would book the volume to the GL and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from TGLO.  Then, we would book a sale from HPLC-Wellhead to ENA-Wellhead for the value of the gas only (no volume) and a sale from ENA-Wellhead to EGM for the value of the crude (no volume).  For these deals, we would use demand fees. EGM will pay ENA for the crude dollars.

   

I will give you the deals for January so you can see how the dollars move.  You will see that the price is still on the sale from HPLC to TGLO.  Julie zeroed this out, but O'Neal put it back.  I've left him a message to find out why.
1.  Sale from HPLC-IM Wellhead to TGLO			547201
2.  Sale from HPLC-IM HPLC to HPLC-IM Wellhead		547205  
3.  Sale from HPLC-Wellhead to ENA-IM Wellhead Texas	679847
4.  Sale from ENA-IM Wellhead Texas to EGM			679859 

Here is a preliminary list of what needs to be done to finish out the transactions for March, April and May.  The previous email went to Kam Keiser, John Grass, Linda Roberts and Dayem Khandker.  They may be able to help us work through this.  Let me know if you have any questions.

2.  Enter a ticket for the HPL-Wellhead sale to ENA-Wellhead for March, April and May 2001 (the Feb deal number is 679848) for the value of the gas below.  This should be entered as a demand fee only, no volume.
