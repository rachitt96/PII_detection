Message Body :In looking at  the MTD prod. vs. nom numbers, we have consistently been under nominated by about 2,000/day at Three Rivers and 2,000/day at the Saxet well.  We are making our imbalance worse, cumulative.  We need to update our forward position and our nomination by 4,000/day to stay in balance to entitlements.
