Message Body :Friday 3/23 - Received a page from Silver in Gas Control at 8:00 pm regarding the Gulf Plains Plant.  They were cut into another pipeline (Tennessee), and wanted to overdeliver to us by 10M for the night.  Larry Zammit paged 8:05 pm, reiterated same.  We agreed to take the additional volume for the remainder of the evening only.

Saturday 3/24 - 7:30 am, received page from Lee in Gas Control regarding the Gulf Plains Plant, apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for Saturday's gas day as well.  Phoned Larry Zammit and spoke with him regarding the situation at the plant, he indicated that there may have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant.  Larry phoned the plant and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver to,  or swing on, HPL.

	2:00 pm - Phoned Lee in Gas Control to see how the pipeline was doing.  He indicated that we were pretty tight, but would probably make it without utilizing any OBA's.

Sunday - So. Union requested 15M beginning at 11:00 am. The pipeline was tight again, but Gas Control was okay.
