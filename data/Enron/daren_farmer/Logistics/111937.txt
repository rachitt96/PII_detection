Message Body :I have a problem with Tristar for May 2001.  The deal number is 779345.  They sent me an invoice for 40,000 from the 24th to the 31st at $3.975.  In our deal, we only have 6,000 on the 24th at $3.975.  Did you do a deal for 40,000?  I can't find a deal on Oasis or on HPL for this amount.
