After talking to both Vance  Taylor and Julie Meyers, only 5 of the 13 deals 
are committed reserve deals.  If they are not committed reserve they're not 
in the IM wellhead portfolio.  The plan if everyone agrees, is to go ahead 
and move the 5 and re-path to them to the  gathering and leave the other 13 
on the 215 contract. Here is a list of the ones to move  and leave.


Move  to IM Wellhead re-path gathering
