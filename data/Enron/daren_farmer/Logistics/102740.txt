Jeff,

Here are more deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books as a result of our contracts auto-terminating.  I hope to finish the list of auto-terminated deals today (if no emergencies arise that pull me off this).

 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for being so patient.
