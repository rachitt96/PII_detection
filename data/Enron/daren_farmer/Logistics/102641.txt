I'm not sure if you can help me, but I have a Danny Conner deal from December 2000 that has a price issue.  

We were buying gas from The Houston Exploration Company on Black Marlin, High Island 138/HPL meter 98663, deal 508426.  The deal was priced at HSC - 0.14.  In December, a new platform came on, High Island 115/HPL meter 986431.  It did not start flowing until the 20th.  Danny did not put a new deal in for this meter, so we combined the gas on deal 508426.  The Houston Exploration thinks that the gas at HI 115 should be kept separate and priced at HSC GD - 0.14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20th.  We agree that we received the gas.  We have the pipeline statement from Black Marlin.  We just don't have the same pricing.  The Houston Exploration shows that we owe them an additional $222k due to this price difference.  We only purchased this gas in Dec 2000 and Jan 2001.  The deal for Jan, 547063, was priced at GD - 0.14.  Can you verify how this deal should be priced?  I sent this issue to Danny back in January and he said the IF price was correct, but The Houston Exploration is sticking to their price.  If you need to talk to their trader, his name is Lester Lipperdt 713-830-6960.
