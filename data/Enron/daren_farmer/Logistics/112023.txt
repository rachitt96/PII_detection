Message Body :Darren:
I have a request from Jim Coffey that I hope you can help me with.  He wants to know the cost of supplying the gas to the GLO.  I can follow the ENA deals in path Manager, but I am having a hard time with the HPLC deals.  It looks like we were using gas from the 215 contract.  I can't tell, though, how the gas got to the 215.  Can you tell me where we got the supply for HPLC to sell and at what price?  I need to know for Jan through May.  The GLO deal numbers are below, if you need them.
