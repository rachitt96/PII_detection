Susan,

Hope you had a great new year and holiday season!  I have a couple of issues 
I want ot clear up for this year's contract.

The question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you 
are currently pulling gas.  Our new contract that was just sent to you has a 
minimum take of 60,000 mmbtu (estimated 35,000 @ 8018 Celanese, 15,000 @ 1233 
Texas City, and 10,000 @ 1394 Dodge Street).  If you undertake at any meter 
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60,000 
mmbtu.  My accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the 
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out.  We discussed 
this on the phone and I got your consent to split these invoices.  Now we are 
being told all three invoices need to be separate.  Since we always aim to 
please the customer, here is my recommendation for handling the contract 
through it's term.  Please let me know if this is fine.

Celanese 35,000 mmbtu/d minimum  On any given day if volumes fall below 
35,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid
      two days after flow

Texas City 15,000 mmbtu/d minimum On any given day if volumes fall below 
15,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid
      two days after flow

Dodge Street 10,000 mmbtu/d minimum On any given day if volumes fall below 
10,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid
      two days after flow

Any excess volumes taken at all three locations would be billed @ GD HSC High 
2 day after
