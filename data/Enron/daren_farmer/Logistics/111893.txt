Subject : Big Cowboy/GEPL Actuals for February

Message Body :Thu,

We have an ongoing issue every month between what we nominate from GEPL into HGPL and on to King Ranch (flows into HGPL at meter 8284) and what is in the system as purchase gas upstream of the meter.  The volume has been anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000/Day over the nomination for at least the past six months.  Would you please fax the meter statements from GEPL for February so that I can try to determine which meters are flowing over what is nominated and verify that we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter.  Should you require a more specific listing, I have Tom's schematic of the area.

Thank you for your time.  Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Mary
