Oasis will be doing away with the temporary passwords for their on-line nom & confirm system effective 4/1/01, so it looks like you will need to review the agreement and get set up on it.  It is not mandatory, however; they are encourageing everyone to get on board.  Let me know what you want to do.  I have attached the agreement, and info on the nom/confirm cycles.  I have been using it this week and it is pretty user friendly.  The reporting capabilities are still being developed, but I am told it should be ready soon.  Take a look for yourself @ www.oasispipeline.com..........logon:  north.....password:  enron........currently, no intradays are allowed online(only by fax/email)  because they want to approve same days, but they are looking at allowing them in the future.
