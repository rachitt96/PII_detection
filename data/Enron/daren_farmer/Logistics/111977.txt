Message Body :Buddy - Daren Farmer called and said that on 4/30/2001, on HPL deal #108058, that there was around 20,000 MMBTU scheduled, but when it was actualized, it was actualized at 0.  He thinks this is incorrect.  Can you check into this and get back with Daren?  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, so please get back with him directly.  Thanks.
