I was on vacation the week that sent this note out.  I was just wondering if 
anyone helped you resolve this?  And if not do you need help?

In November volume was applied to deal #92963 when, in fact, all volume 
should be on 125066. Please effect this change asap and insure December is 
set up for 125066. Deal #92963 should have been terminated at the end of 
October.

Thanks
Ken
