I needed the demand charge for April entered on supply deal 229758.  It can stay on sale deal 157278 if you want, but it will need to be changed to a negative demand charge.

I have some changes to the DEFS deals for 2001.  We need to add demand fees for the over delivery and excess charges.  I have attached the spreadsheets in case you need them. 
Prod.		Deal		Demand Fee
Feb 2001	157278		$11,903.17
March 2001	157278		$294.85
April 2001	229758		$308.53

 << File: HPL's Calc Sheet FEB_2001.xls >>  << File: HPL's Calc Sheet March_2001.xls >>  << File: HPL's Calc Sheet April_2001.xls >> 

Thanks,
Megan
