Message Body :Darren:
I have a price issue with MGI Supply for January 2001.  For deal 551414, we have tiered pricing for days 13-16.  The first 20,000 at $8.71 and everything over at Agua Dulce GDP + $0.01.  MGI has the deal priced at the GDP + $0.01 only.  They do not have the $8.71.  Should this pricing be tiered?  MGI would owe us $10,600.00 if we go with their pricing.
