Hi Mark!

Another interconnect issue - 7/99:

Can you please take a look at deal 109660?  It is set up with a transport 
usage ticket, however is a brokered deal.  I am not sure if it is pathed 
incorrectly or if possibly the deal is set up incorrectly.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Karen
