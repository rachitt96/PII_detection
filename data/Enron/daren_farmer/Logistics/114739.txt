Steve - 

One issue that immediately comes to mind is the 'General Terms and  
Conditions' ability to handle intra-day nominations. .This may require a new 
Product Type and GTC. 

Are we presently trading this product OTC, or is this unprecedented?

We are finalizing plans to introduce a new gas products(s) for July.  The 
product(s) would be an hourly product either 5x8 or 5x12 or 5x16.  
Even though we have not decided which product to introduce, I thought I would 
give you a heads up to keep you in the loop.
