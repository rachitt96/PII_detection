I'll follow-up on this, but I'm sure you know it isn't a very likely story.  
I'll be in Saudi this Friday, so if Mr. Maldonado has any leads there I can 
check'em out.

Please say hi to Doug and tell him we're getting a little closer to that gas 
pipeline to displace liquids on the Saudi west coast.

Regards,

Samir

Rob, 

I got your name from Doug Leach.  He  thought that you would be the person to 
talk to about this.

I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.  (The operator forwarded him 
our way.)  He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia.  
His number is 562-866-1755.  Could you give him a call and check this out?  I 
told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.

I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.
