Subject : Desk to Desk Ticket between NNG and PGEV and OPLC

Message Body :Daren has copied the old ticket and reput the volumes on a new deal ticket, dating back to the first, which reflects the correct Texas desk entity.  All of the buys/sales currently transacted at Waha by the Texas desk are done by HPLC-HPLC.  Please check your deal tickets as any volumes for April will need to be repathed, nom'd, etc.

Thank you,

Mary
