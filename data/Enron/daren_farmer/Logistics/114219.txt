Message Body :Tom,

Can you please seek Daren's advise on nom adjust at the aforementioned meter 
due to this meter receiving 19 mmbtu's on a 28 nom?

Daren, there are two Sitara deal numbers associated w/this receipt meter 
(both gathering) 154608 and 138572.  138572 is Wellhead gas.

Thanks
-Jackie-
