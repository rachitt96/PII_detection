It is my understanding the outages Valero incurred at the above locations are 
force majure situations during December and should not trigger the buyback 
feature of the contract.

Gary, I have not seen any documentation of this from Valero. Please follow up 
with your counterpart to secure the letter of notice or we will need to 
process the deal as if the buyback is active.

Thanks 

Ken
