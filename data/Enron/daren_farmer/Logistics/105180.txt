Message Body :Duke will be paid 9/22 for  May 2000 through July 2000.  We should have the 
August 2000 invoice by the end of next week. Megan Parker is handling this 
deal going forward and has contacted Duke to request an invoice for August.  
Megan was not receiving invoices, and since it is our policy to withhold 
payment unless we are invoiced, payment was not made on this until now.

Kris, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) 
Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke 
(Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 
5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me 
know where we stand.

Thanks.
