Subject : Month End Close Schedule *REVISED*

Message Body :Changes are in blue.

Last month there was some confusion from several schedulers I spoke to about when changes could be made to (August) after the cut off:  As noted in the table, after Friday, August 31st at 6PM there can be no changes (i.e. re-nominate, re-track, re-balance, bridge back to Sitara etc.) made to August production until Wednesday morning, September 5th.  

At 6PM Friday (or before if you are ready) I will be by to pick up the reports and exceptions dialogue.

thx
