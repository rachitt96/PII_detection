I have 2 allocation exceptions that require a deal to be extended.  Meter 
98-1488 Tenaska is showing small volumes flowed on days there was no deal.  
Can you extend the deal throughout the month so that the volumes will have a 
deal to link to.    I have the same situation on meter 98-1601.

If you have any questions, please let  me know.

Thanks,

Susan
