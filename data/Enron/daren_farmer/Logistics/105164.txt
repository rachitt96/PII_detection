Message Body :This deal was not put in right.  The primary term of the contract goes out to 
9/30/00.  There is no evergreen to the contract.  The deal will end when the 
contract ends.  Therefore, I have taken the evergreen off, and added 
September to it.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Julie

Please review deal 133010.  The deal shows evergreen, but nothing rolled to
