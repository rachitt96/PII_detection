I need help on this one.  I spoke to Gary shortly after he sent this e-mail the other day.  I wasn't sure what to say in the letter regarding how long they would be shut in -- Is there some repair that needs to be done to remedy the situation?  Are we ever going to take the gas again?  Should I tell them that it will remain shut in until the gas meets our specs?

At Gary's suggestion, I called Mike Morris & left a message, but haven't heard back from him.  Therefore, I am sending this e-mail to see if anyone else can give me some advise on the contents of the notification letter that I need to send out.

Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.

Subject:	Shut-in of Meter 989842

Meter 0989842 Tri-C Resources Gov. Daniel was shut in at approximately 12:00 PM on Friday April 13.  The producer was shut in due to high hydrocarbon dew point.

If you have any questions please call me at 3.6449.

Thanks
Gary Hanks
