Subject : Pipeline Nominations away from the office.

Message Body :These troubled times mandate that Enron take a fresh look at our contingency plans for conducting business away from the office.  Bob Superty has asked me to put together a survey on processes and equipment that could be used if schedulers could not get into the office and use normal business processes and resources.

Please forward this memo and ask your respective schedulers to take a moment to fill in the requested data from your desk spreadsheets below.  We would like to have all responses received before November 1st. 

Please e-mail all responses to Richard Pinion with an updated Excel spreadsheet attached.  I will put together a master sheet from the individual replies.

thx
Richard Pinion
