Rich & Ellen:

We have some problems with the following two counterparties: TXU Gas Distribution & Enbridge Consumers Gas.  For TXU Gas Distribution, this is a unconsolidated division of TXU Gas Company and all deals booked under TXU Gas Distribution should be confirmed as TXU Gas Company.  I understand this is not the case.  For Enbridge Consumers Gas, this is not a valid entity.  At some point it will be a correct name, but for now deals should be confirmed and booked under Consumers Gas Co. Ltd.  

Each has a relatively recent deal booked to it that need to be changed as described above: Sitara 1085609 for TXU and 1086002 for Enbridge Consumers Gas.  

Please advise if there is something I need to do from my end to get this issue resolved.  

Thanks,
Max Sonnonstine
