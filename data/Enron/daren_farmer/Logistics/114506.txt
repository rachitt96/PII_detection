Message Body :I decreased volumes at Carthage due to a fire at the East Texas Plant.  Also, 
the co-owner volumes provided were given to me as gross volumes and should 
have been net (after PVR).  I have made changes to reflect the lower volumes. 
The total volume change is approx 5500 (net). Total Carthage decreases from 
90565 to 85148 (net).
