Subject : Training Resources and Cost to attend Energy Operations systems classes

Message Body :As a follow-up to Stephen Schwarz's message below regarding training 
resources, I wanted to let everyone know that there will not be a charge in 
2000 for any Energy Operations employee to attend any training classes that 
have been developed by Energy Operations (i.e., Sitara, Unify and 
Magellan/LiveLink).  There will be a charge to your RC, however, if an Energy 
Operations employee signs up for one of these classes and fails to cancel 
within the established guidelines.

I know there was a lot of concern regarding your budget and costs for 
training classes after the Corporate Training Department announced that there 
would be a change in policy this year.  Your RC will be charged a fee for any 
course that your employee signs up and attends through ERNIE.  I just wanted 
to clarify the costs associated for any systems training detailed above will 
not be charged to your RC even though you and your employees use ERNIE to 
register for these classes.  I have instructed the people in the Training 
Department who are in charge of billing to follow this policy.  If you 
receive a charge in error on your RC report, please let me know immediately 
so that I can make the necessary corrections.

If you have any further questions, please call me.  Thanks.

Subject: Training Resources

Beginning March 1, the training resources you have been using from the 
Project Sirius team, (Elwanda Bennett and Joyce Jenkins), will no longer be 
available.  We have outsourced the delivery of operational training, 
including the systems-oriented training that Elwanda and Joyce have been 
delivering, to TEAMLeadership Center.  Many of you are already working with 
TEAMLeadership on the development of operational training for Energy 
Operations.  TEAMLeadership will be working this year to integrate our 
systems training and operational training into a single coordinated training 
effort tailored to the needs of Energy Operations.

In an effort to manage effectively  both priorities and dollars spent, Lisa 
Cousino will be ENA's point of contact with TEAMLeadership.  Please make Lisa 
aware of all services requested from TEAMLeadership.  If you have any 
questions about these arrangements, please call Lisa at X36343.

Please share this information with your staff.

Stephen
