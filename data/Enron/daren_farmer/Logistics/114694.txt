Message Body :Okay guys,

This one has been corrected.  The measured volumes pulled through this 
morning.  The allocations are corrected with deal #92399 on the 215 contract 
taking the swing.

Anything else just let me know.

Charlotte,
Please verify CP&L back to the first of June.  Darren told me that it is 
allocating incorrectly and it
is causing part of our UA4 problem for current month.  Please check this out 
asap.  Thanks,  Pat
