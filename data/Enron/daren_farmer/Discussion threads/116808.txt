Message Body :CR and AL, 

We bought 8000 from Richardson (#245410) at Teco - Lone Star Katy and sold it 
to Tufco at that point on 5/12/00.  At 3am Tufco cut us on the sale, 
resulting in only 6,000 flowing to Tufco for the day.  We need to find out 
what PGE did with the remaining 2,000 we bought from Richardson.  Did they 
deliverit to us at HPL?  Or did they cut Richardson?  Or, are they showing 
that we have gas stranded at that point?  Please look into this and let me 
know.
