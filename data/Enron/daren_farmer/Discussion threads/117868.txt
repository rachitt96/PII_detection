Message Body :Like we talked about in our meeting in August, I am  planning on?getting 
material out for discussion on the Friday preceding the  NEON meeting.? If it 
would help you to get it sooner, let me know so we can  see what would help.? 
Also, if you can't open the attachment (it is written  in Microsoft Word), 
let me know so that we can again do whatever's necessary to  get it to you.
?
Keep me in touch with how things are going for your  group; successes, 
problems, etc.? I'll be praying for your  groups.
?
In Him,
?
