Message Body :Each of you have been chosen by one or more of my direct reports to provide 
mid-year feedback.  I just wanted to urge you to provide this to me ASAP, as 
my PRC meeting wil be 6/13, even though the feedback system is open through 
6/16.  Therefore, I need your feedback by FRIDAY, 6/9 so that I can use the 
week-end to get ready.  Although I would prefer the feedback through the 
system, if you are finding yourself in a bind for time, please provide me 
your feedback verbally either through voicemail (mark it private) or I would 
be happy to meet with you.

I know we all receive many of these requests, but I sincerely appreciate 
constructive feedback.  Thanks in advance for your input!
