Message Body :I spoke with Larry Zamit this morning regarding the outage January 1 through 
6.  He agreed to hold the gas for us and batch it throughout the rest of 
January.  At this point we have 3,007 nominated for 1/1/00 and that is what 
he has agreed to hold.

Questions??  Give me a call.
