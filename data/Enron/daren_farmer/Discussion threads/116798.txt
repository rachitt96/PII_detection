Message Body :Jo Williams has asked me to help her update this map, to provide Enron Corp. 
"IT" so they may add a  point and click map on the "inter net".  I have 
contacted some of you by phone to update the attached map, I am asking all of 
you to please carefully review this entire map, title, legend, numbers, 
spelling all of it.  Please reply whether you have changes or not, about the 
information that appears on it.  GIVE ME AN APPROVAL OR  DECLINE IT.  I 
realize this is short notice but we would need this at least by 3 :00 PM 
today Wed may 24th, Jo is trying to place this in the hands of Will Zamer 
today.
Keep in mind that this map will probably be revised from some of your 
comments, so it is NOT a map that should be distributed from any of you, in 
fact you can delete it after you've provided us the help. I will resubmit  
the final map upon it's completion. Thank-you all.
 All your time is greatly appreciated.
regards'
Maria Salazar
