Subject : 03/01 Assignment, Termination, Expiration Report - Houston Pipe Line

Message Body :Since I did the revision to the February 2001 report so late last month, I 
accidentally failed to do the report for March 2001.  Attached is a report 
for March 2001 which covers all assignments, terminations & expirations 
entered since the last report was done on 2/15/01.  There will be a new 
report done around March 22nd in preparation for Bid Week.
