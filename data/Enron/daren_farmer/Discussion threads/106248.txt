Subject : Name Change/Merger Listing for 7/00

Message Body :This is the preliminary spreadsheet for July. There will definitely be 
another listing distributed no later than this Friday. For some reason there 
has been an unusual number of notices issued and we are working diligently to 
get the documents lined up. 

Updates to records in GCP for counterparty name changes:

The legal name field will be updated Monday afternoon (7/17). 

The ERMS Shortnames will be changed on Tuesday afternoon (7/18).
