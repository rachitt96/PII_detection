Subject : Deliveries into Channel at Gulf Plains

Message Body :Duke is calling regarding the volumes we are delivering into Channel at the 
Gulf Plains Plant.  Apparently, we are half of the volumes delivered at the 
meter and Channel is pressuring the plant back.  Duke has asked if we will 
take the additional gas which is "undeliverable",  I think we may need to 
move our markets to another meter, ie. HPL/Agua.  Please advise.
