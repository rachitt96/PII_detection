Subject : Operations Pricing Model - Hours Survey

Message Body :If you assisted in the completion of the OPM Hours Survey in the past and/or 
are expected to in the future, you will need access to Microsoft Access 
beginning Wednesday, September 27, 2000.  If you do not have Microsoft 
Access, please go to the enron.itcentral.com website and complete an IT 
application request for Microsoft Access as soon as possible.

If you are not the individual who will be updating the hours surveys, please 
(1) coordinate with the individual who will and (2) notify Suzanne Nicholie 
at #57341.

On Wednesday, September 27, 2000 a new Hours Survey will be distributed to 
you and will be due for completion on Wednesday, October 4, 2000.

We have developed what we think to be an easier and more efficient method of 
handling the Hours Survey using Microsoft Access.  The Hours Survey is menu 
driven and you are not expected to need specific Microsoft Access training.

We will provide help lines and as needed direct training with the roll out of 
the new Hours Survey.  If you have any questions please contact anyone in the 
OPM group.
