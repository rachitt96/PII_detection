Attached please find a schedule that shows all the active HPL Inter-Company 
Contracts that are recorded in the Global Contract System.  The dark shaded 
contracts are needed to perform HPL's daily/monthly activities.    Each of 
these have a comment.  

The lightly shaded contracts had activity in Year 2000, but  will not be 
needed for future activities.

The non- shaded contracts did not have any activity in Year 2000, and will 
not be needed for future activities.

This schedule was compiled by using information provided by Cheryl Dudley,
