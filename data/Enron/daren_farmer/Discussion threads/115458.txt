Subject : McMullen Gas for 11/99

Message Body :Jackie,

Since the inlet to 3 River Plant is shut in on 10/19/99 (the last day of 
flow):
at what meter is the McMullen gas being diverted to?
at what meter is HPL buying the residue gas? (this is the gas from Teco, 
Vastar, Vintage, Tejones, and Swift)

I still see active deals at meter 3405 in Path Manager for Teco, Vastar, 
Vintage, Tejones, and Swift
I also see gas scheduled in POPS at meter 3404 and  3405.  

Please advice.   We need to resolve this as soon as possible so Settlement 
can send out payments.

Thanks
