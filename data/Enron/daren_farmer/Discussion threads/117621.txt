Subject : Cornhusker Meeting

Message Body :Please plan to attend a brief meeting at 11:00 am, Monday - Aug. 21, to 
review Project Cornhusker.  The goal is to gain a better understanding of the 
deal and what will be required by everyone involved.  Bob has graciously 
offered to let us meet in his office (Sally Beck's old office).  

See you then.

Dave
