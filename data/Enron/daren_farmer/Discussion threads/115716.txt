Subject: Review Texas Budget Meeting

Please plan to attend a meeting Tuesday the 25th from 4 - 5 pm reviewing the 
Texas Budgets.  You will receive hard copies of the budgets tomorrow. Please 
review them and hold ALL questions and concerns until the meeting.  If at all 
possible please forward your questions to me so that I may compile a list to 
be delivered to Lisa Cousino Tuesday morning.

Thank you!
Yvette
