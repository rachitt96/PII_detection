Message Body :Daren - Would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378 
for  March 2000 going forward?  It would help out with the allocation 
process.  The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal # 115101.  
Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this 
done today.  Thanls.

Aimee:

The ENA 012-27049-02-002 and HPL 012-41500-02-016 contract are not at Meter 
378 for March 2000.  I need for you to put the correct deal number for both 
contracts in Path Manager.

We need the ENA 202 contract as a delivery and the HPL 216 as a receipt.  
Please get the deal in the System this morning and let me know what the deal 
numbers are and I will set up the arraignments and let you know what the 
Track ID's are.

Thanks,

Fred
