Message Body :As most of you have probably heard already, I am leaving Enron to pursue some 
new endeavors.  I will be moving back home to Toronto and I'm going to take 
some time off to do some travelling.  I plan to go back to school in January, 
and after that.... we'll see what life has in store!  

I wanted to thank all of you for the many wonderful experiences I have had 
here at Enron.  It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know you 
all.  I hope that if you're ever in Toronto you will drop me a line.

My last day of work will be June 30th, however, I will be staying in Houston 
until the end of July.  I hope to see or speak to all of you before I leave, 
but if I don't manage to, please keep in touch.  My e-mail address is 
jennifer_sabine@yahoo.com.

Take care and good luck!
Jennifer
