Message Body :I can not begin to express my heart filled "THANKS"  for all of the time and 
effort that everyone put into this successful Y2K effort.  It was truly great 
to see everyone working together to ensure that ENRON continues in it winning 
way by being the best at what we do.  I was truly blessed with the group of 
individuals listed above and their staffs that put the heart and soul into 
this process.  We have an outstanding team of individuals who in my opinion 
will always go the extra mile for ENRON..   Again, Thanks everyone you have a 
lot to be proud - " We successfully survived the Y2K event !!!"
