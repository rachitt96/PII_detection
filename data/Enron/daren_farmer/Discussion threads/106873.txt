Rick,
Bob Hall, Daren Farmer and I met on Thursday regarding the fee--I have a very 
rough draft done and my plan is to revise and edit today and tomorrow. 
However, I  spoke with Dan Lyons yesterday regarding some issues with the 
supply contracts that concerned me and he agrees that we need to look into 
them further. In addition, Bob Hall, Daren and I thought we might could use a 
brief tutorial on the structure of the transaction generally, the parties 
involved and their correct legal names and their relationship to Enron. Dan 
Lyons has volunteered to give us that tutorial but will not be available 
until early next week when he and I will meet to discuss the supply contract 
issues as well. Call me if you have any questions--
