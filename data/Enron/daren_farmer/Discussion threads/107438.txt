Subject : OPM Hours Survey - December, 2000

Message Body :It's that time again to enter your hours and activities for December, 2000.  
Please use the shortcut below or go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM 
Hours Survey\ProdUser to access the hours survey.

When completing the FTE's section of the survey, if there are any Director, 
Sr. Admin or Admin positions in your cost center, please complete 
accordingly.  You are not expected to complete a hours survey for these 
positions but we do need them to be included in your FTE's.

There is a new report that shows your cost center's hours from the prior 
month in the reports button in the "Multiple User" survey.  To view hours 
entered for prior months, select a report from the column "Select a Month".  

Please have your survey's completed by Friday, January 5.  Please call me if 
you have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey.

Thanks,
Suzanne
