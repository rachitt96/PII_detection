Janet.  I am back from vacation.   I have updated the HL&P flow MTD.   Jill 
told me that on the 18th,19 th and 20th the San Jac. nom  should be 29,209.  
Is this correct?  We'll need to change sitara.  I have had scada problems at 
Meter 1401.  Gas Control has given me a verbal  from the 14th on.  I will 
monitor scada and adjust as necessary.  Let me know if there is anything else 
that I can do.  Thanks.
