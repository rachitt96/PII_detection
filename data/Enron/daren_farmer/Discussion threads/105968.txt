Please see the attached revisions to be effective 6/10/00 on HI 325 and HI 
368 platforms.

Darren - We will probably make another change to HI 368 effective Tuesday, 
June 13 once we hear from the pipeline on reallocating the gas.  I will let 
you if we need to change the nom for Tuesday, June 13.

Please let me know of any questions you have.

Thanks,
