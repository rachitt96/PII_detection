Deal #231757
Purchase

The deal in sitara indicates that the price for East Texas Gas Systems is  
HSC, Index -$.085.
Per the contract, the redelivery  at ETGS Carthage Hub Tailgate should be 
priced at  HSC Index -$.0825.  
Are these the same points and is the price correct?


Thanks
katherine
