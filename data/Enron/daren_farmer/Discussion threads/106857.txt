Message Body :We did take into account the price adjustments you made.  The actual purchase 
cashout for 8/00 was $118,103.67.  Your pricing took care of most of the 
cashout, but there was still a balance.  The over delivery pricing per MMBtu 
in the contract is the difference between HSC Spot - 0.05 and HSC Index, so 
GD - 0.10 didn't quite cover the entire cashout.  I have attached the calc 
sheet in case you need it.
