Message Body :Hi,
?
Am I to understand that not a single team in my adopted state  won a bowl 
game? 
?
I guess I will stay loyal to the CORNHUSKERS as they seemed to  handle being 
pissed off about not playing in a better bowl. We need more meat  than the 
big 10 can throw out.
?
Well now it is down to next year again.....................  
?
Did Cole get enough trucks from Santa ..................... or  did Jake eat 
them? I'm sure it was fun.
?
