Subject : PG&E Texoma Volumes

Message Body :In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma 
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance 
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of 
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some 
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have 
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the 
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a 
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a 
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.  
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving 
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.
