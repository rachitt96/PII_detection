Subject : Over $50 -- You made it happen!

Message Body :On Wall Street, people are talking about Enron.  At Enron, we're talking 
about people...our people.  You are the driving force behind every success 
that our company has experienced, including our high-performing stock price, 
which surpassed the $50 mark only a few days ago. You made it happen!

To show our appreciation for your hard work and commitment to Enron,s 
continued success, eligible regular full-time and regular part-time employees 
who were on the payroll of a wholly-owned Enron company at Dec. 31, 1999 will 
receive 50 Enron stock options.  A special stock option award certificate and 
a copy of the stock plan will be sent to you in the next few weeks.

About the stock options grant:
The grant was effective Jan. 18, 2000, therefore, the option grant price is 
$55.50.
Options will have a seven-year term, which means you must exercise these 
options before seven years have passed.
Options will vest 25 percent on Feb. 28, 2000 and 25 percent each subsequent 
January 18th thereafter until fully vested, as long as you are an employee of 
Enron.  This means you may exercise 25 percent of these options as early as 
Feb. 28.
This grant is made in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Enron 
Corp. Stock Plans and the award documents, which you will receive in the 
coming weeks. 

Due to varying international restrictions and legalities, Enron employees in 
certain international locations will receive some other form of recognition.  
Your local management and human resources representative will communicate 
further details.

To help celebrate this occasion Plaza Java located in the Enron Building will

while quantities last.

Again, thank you for all you do to make Enron a successful global energy and 
broadband services company and a great place to work.
