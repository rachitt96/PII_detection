Could you add meter PGE-LS 491-754 to TXU Fuel deal #108672 for May 12, 2000 
in Sitara?  TXU received 2,000 mmbtu on that day as part of the Gas Daily 
contract, however, the volume is pathed under the Wagner Brown contract due 
to the meter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rebecca
