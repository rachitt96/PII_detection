Subject : real time deal updates to Path Manager - test group

Message Body :Beginning this week, we are actively testing the changes to Path Manager to 
receive real-time deal updates from Sitara.  To prepare for this, we would 
like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick 
walkthru/training of the new features sometime early next week.  This should 
only take about 30 minutes.  Once they are comfortable with the features and 
performance, and once the testing is complete, we would like to migrate this 
to Unify Production either next week or the week after.  This should give us 
an adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week.

Once it is migrated to Production, we can either roll it out to all 
schedulers or to selected schedulers via security.

Heather, could you please schedule some time with the designated schedulers, 
Scotty, and myself early next week.  A room with a projector would work best.

Thanks, d.n.
