Message Body :TO:  Employees attending 75th Anniversary Celebration

With the countdown underway for Houston Pipe Line,s 75th anniversary 
celebration in Galveston on September 9, here is information that I think you,
ll find helpful in finalizing your plans.  I,m delighted that almost 500 
employees and their guests will be attending our anniversary celebration in 
Galveston!

HOTEL ARRANGEMENTS
Due to such tremendous response from employees, we have run out of rooms in 
the Moody Gardens Hotel, Seven Hope Blvd.  Some of you will be staying at an 
equally fine hotel, the Hilton Resort, 5400 Seawall Blvd. The Hilton is a 
sister hotel to the San Luis and amenities include a heated swimming pool, 
Jacuzzi, tennis court and fitness room. Hilton Guests can also enjoy special 
San Luis facilities by showing their room cards.  

CHECKING IN AND OUT
Each HPL employee will receive a Party-Pak that includes your *Garden 
Dollars, drink tickets, name tags and several special gifts.  Pick up your 
party pack and hotel confirmation number for both the Hilton and Moody 
Gardens hotels in the lobby of the Moody Gardens Hotel any time after 10 a.m. 
Saturday morning.  

The official check in time at both hotels is 4 p.m. on Saturday, September 
9.  However, the hotels will make rooms available to HPL guests before 
mid-afternoon if possible.   Both hotels have also made arrangements to check 
your bags in advance if your room is not ready.  Please check with the desk 
when you arrive at your hotel.  Check out time is noon on Sunday, September 
10.

Hotel parking is available outdoors or underground at the valet parking 
entrance sign at the back of the hotel.

*Garden Dollars are like currency at Moody Garden attractions, restaurants, 
lounges, gift shop and spa.  Use them any time on Saturday or Sunday or keep 
them and use them on a subsequent trip to Galveston within the next year. 

IF YOUR PLANS CHANGE
If your personal plans change between now and the celebration on September 9, 
please email meetingstop@aol.com to let us know that you are canceling your 
hotel room and dinner reservations.  We appreciate your courtesy!

COCKTAILS & DINNER
Cocktails are at 6:30 p.m. and dinner at 7:30 on Saturday, September 9 in the 
Moody Gardens Ballroom.  Be sure that you and your guest wear your name 
badges that are included in your party pack because you must be appropriately 
identified as a Houston Pipe Line employee or guest for cocktails and dinner. 

WHAT TO WEAR
Suitable attire includes jackets for the men and corresponding dressy ladies, 
clothes.
