Per the request of the management team, attached is a form to assist managers 
in documenting performance improvement guidelines for poor performers.  There 
are two pages: Page one is the template with a brief description of the 
information needed on it.  Page two is a completed example to show how it 
might look when finished. 

Please begin working with the appropriate manager in completing the document 
for those individuals who have a ranking of Needs Improvement or Issues for 
2000 Mid Year review.  In order to complete section of the form titled 
'Agreed Developmental Plans', managers must provide quantifiable evidence of 
previous lack of satisfactory performance.  

As discussed in prior meetings, reviews requiring developmental plans should 
be conducted by two levels of management.  Also, HR and Legal must review 
prior to employee receiving developmental plan and counselling.  Please 
complete and submit by Monday, July 17, 2000.  



Please call if you have any questions or to set time aside to discuss the 
developmental plan.
