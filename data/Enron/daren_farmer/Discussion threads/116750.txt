The Storage Book book will purchase 788,354 mmbtu's from Cannon Interest on 
May 1, 2000 @ $3.08.
Daren- Please enter Texas purchase from Cannon Interest and a Texas sale to 
the Storage Book in the sitara.
George and Aimee-  Please coordinate with Daren so your entries are entered 
on the same day.
Mary- The contract agreement, I assume, is already in place.

wired to Cannon Interest @ the corrected ABA on May 20th.
