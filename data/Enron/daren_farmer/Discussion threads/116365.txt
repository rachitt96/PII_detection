Subject : Nominations for rest of April 1

Message Body :Effective 4/1/2000:

Nomination into Eastrans of 75,000 MMBtu/d.

Redeliveries:

50,000 MMBtu/d into PG & E
7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley
17,200 to HPL at Carthage

Currently, since 3/22/2000, we have been at 75,000
with the following redeliveries:

43,482 MMBtu/d into PG & E
7,000 from Fuels Cotton Valley

I previously showed 44,382 MMBtu/d since 3/22 .  Is 43,482 right?

There is no change in deliveries and redeliveries for tomorrow, but
could someone clarify what the nominations are on the redelivery side?
