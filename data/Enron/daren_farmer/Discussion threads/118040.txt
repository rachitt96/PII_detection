Gary:

This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed 
volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892  
today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at 
meter #980439.

Daren:

This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should 
clear within 24 to 48 hours.

Victor:

This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes 
for you.



IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME AT X-3665O.

THANKS, CLEM
