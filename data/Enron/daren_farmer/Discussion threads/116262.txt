As we discussed, due to weather we decided to reschedule our maintenance,
and noms have been returned to 75,000 MMBtu/d effective today and following,
until further notice.  15,000 MMBtu will come from CIPCO into Mobil Beaumont,
50,000 into PG & E, and 7,000 from Fuels Cotton Valley into HPL.

Unless a problem arises, we plan to stay at this level until Tuesday, 
3/21/2000,
when we will go down some for 1 day only.
