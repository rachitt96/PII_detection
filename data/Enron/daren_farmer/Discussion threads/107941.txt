Message Body :Saturday:

Mark from Aquilla was short 5000 into the Valero Hub and it appeared that 
PG&E may have to cut Aquilla's delivery into us, but Mark was able to get the 
5000 he needed to make the delivery.
Transco Bammel had some Unit testing by Transco preventing flow until 9 PM.  
I got with Robert A. From the East desk and he decided to go ahead and cut 
the nom down to 30 for Saturday's gas day.  I changed the confirm in Pops to 
reflect it.
Changed confirm for Midcon Hardy to show the correct 20,000.
Changed the confirm for Flaggstaff to show the correct 0.
Communicated with Reggie from Dynegy to get 4,000 at Transco Markham for 
Saturday's gas day confirmed with Transco.  It was finally confirmed later 
that night.

Sunday

At 6:00 the flow into Valero Riverside was 0'd out and changed to Valero 
T'Ville for the remainder of the gas day.  Gas Control said to do it 
verbally.  I could not get a hold of any scheduler with PG&E to see the 
contractual impact.  I let Ed Gottlob know and he said to just let it flow.
