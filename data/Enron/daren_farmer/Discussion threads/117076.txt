Hi,

You probably already heard... test of the new Sybase data base release is off

least verify their security access today.  If you do not have access, please 
contact Diane Niestrath at 3-9931 or Dave McMullan at 3-9127.

Subject: Unify stress test next week with Sybase 12.0

We have done some preliminary testing of the latest version of Sybase 
(version 12).  We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and 
would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me 
showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to 
hardware and business restrictions.

The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the 
days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of 
their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for 
your staff!

The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test 
Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window, 
select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not 
work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says 
that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions 
where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for 
those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try 
to login some time Monday to insure they have access.

The test script during the time period will be:
12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports
12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing
12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in

Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very 
important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should 
pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks 
with poor system performance the better!

Thanks in advance for your help, d.n.
