Message Body :I received an invoice from PG&E Texas Industrial Energy for 6/00 production 
and I do not see one of the pieces in Unify.  They are invoicing us for 
50,000 MMBtu at 4.16 on 6/13.  Is this a good deal?  If it is, please tell me 
the deal number.  I checked path manager and I do not see anything there 
either.

Thanks,
Megan
