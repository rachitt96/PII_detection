Message Body :Hi,

I figured something must be occupying your time other than answering 
non-business e-mail.

You guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each. ---- 
right? (chuckle).

If Tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have 
the time; lunch would be great. Just give me a call. Only if all the ifs 
really allow you the time.

Is Craig ok?? I hope.

I would be glad to help with your sprinkler system. My sharpshooter is older 
than you are, but I imagine it is built a little better. My requested wages 
for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you. I 
would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer. That would be 
free of charge.

I'm having a cable modem installed Monday. Supposed to be 50-70 times faster 
than what I have. I do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem. 
I can then dump my other phone line. Actually will end up spending less for 
more speed. I love technology.

Thanks for the info on the stock option. That is the closing price as of 
1/18/00, which is right before the jump. very nice of management. I like to 
know the number to see what might be affecting the price.

Well good luck on the extra job and give our best to Tonya ---- Not much 
longer to go...........

Ken
