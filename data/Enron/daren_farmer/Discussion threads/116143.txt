Subject : Role of Brian Heinrich and Jennifer Blay in Energy Operations

Message Body :I am pleased to announce that Brian Heinrich will be joining the Strategic 
Operations group effective March 1.  Brian will be working with me on the 
budget and will help me to continue to develop processes and procedures that 
will streamline the monthly review of charges on your RC reports.  He will be 
working closely with his replacement in Financial Operations, Jennifer Blay, 
to accomplish this.  Jennifer has been previously providing support to the IT 
organization just as Brian had for Energy Operations.  Therefore, you will 
start receiving messages from Jennifer, like the one below.

Please join me in welcoming Brian to Energy Operations as well as Jennifer 
Blay in her new support role for Energy Operations.  If you have any 
questions regarding these personnel changes, please feel free to call me.  
You may continue to contact Brian with your questions as he works to 
transition responsibilities to Jennifer over the next few weeks.  But please 
know that Brian and I will be working with all of you, as well as Jennifer, 
to make things easier for each of you to control your 2000 budget.  Thank you 
for your continued support.
