Subject : Performance Evaluation

Message Body :Dear Managers & Supervisors, 
Thank you for your participation and contributions to the Year End 2000 PRC 
process.    It was a privilege for me to witness all of you making decisions 
that were beneficial to Enron and the development of the employees that you 
supervise.    Now what remains to be done is to give your employees their 
feedback verbally and in written form. 
I encourage all of you to complete your employee's evaluations before bonuses 
and merit increases are given on 2/5/01.

Please remember:

 All employees in non-bonusable categories must have their performance 
evaluations reviewed by HR and Legal before the evaluation is presented to 
the employee.    
Rankings will remain confidential and will not be communicated to employees. 
HR will participate as observers of some reviews. 

Let us know how we can assist you,
Your HR Team
