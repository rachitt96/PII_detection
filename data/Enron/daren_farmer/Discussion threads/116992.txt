Subject : Beta Test Site for Enron.com

Message Body :Thank you for all the assistance you have provided during the past 2 months 
in enhancing Enron's Products & Services message for the enron.com web site.  
We now have a beta server up with the new look & feel as well as the new 
services content.  Once everyone's comments are in, this content will be 
merged with the existing enron.com content.  Please visit the test site 
today--I want to hear if we included all the links & descriptions necessary 
for your business unit's services & .com sites.

http://test4.enron.com      (It is only visible from within Enron until 
approved)

Again, thank you for helping to craft an accurate message about Enron's broad 
family of services.  It would not be possible without your participation.  
Your comments will be incorporated into our test site as soon as I receive 
them.

Our schedule to complete the project is as follows:
June 12 to 19 - Beta site open for evaluation and comment.
June 20 to 23 - Final comments & changes incorporated into test site.
June 23 - Launch.  New Services content added to enron.com site.

Additionally, this new site is being shown to each company's CEO, President, 
etc. to ensure we have the message & link correct for each business unit.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.
