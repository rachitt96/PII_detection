It's done, finito!   Please delete the map that I sent to you earlier today, 
it have been REVISED. Attached is the FINAL version. It seems some of you are 
having a difficult time viewing and printing it correctly . If you would like 
a paper copy or copies, just ask me.  This map is NOT to be edited by anyone, 
until the time comes for the next update. I am trying not to duplicate work 
or have conflicting information on this map. When we do updates I will 
contact all of you again, for your input. Thank-you.
Your time was greatly appreciated.
Happy Memorial Day!!

in a specific format let me know.
