Message Body :FYI - I've entered estimated vols into Sitara based on the following info 
from Mobil:

Jan 28 - their takes will be down by 15,000/d from current takes, due to one 
of their crude units coming down
Jan 29 - their takes will be down by an adiitional 5,000/d on top of that, 
due to their coker coming down

For Feb00, they estimated the following vols:

Feb 1 - 5 115,000/d
Feb 6 - 11 120,000/d
Feb 12 - 14 105,000/d
Feb 15 - 18 110,000/d
Feb 19 - 21 105,000/d
Feb 22 - 23 115,000/d
Feb 24 - 26 105,000/d
Feb 27 - 29 115,000/d

Based on assuming:
- Centana delivery point @ zero for all of Feb,
- high pressure delivery @ meter 1576 @ 15,000/d for all of Feb,
- EOG transport of 10,000/d @ meter 1040 for all of Feb,

.... I then entered the remaining daily vols for meter 1040.
