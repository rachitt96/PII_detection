Message Body :This Thursday's Off-Site has been cancelled in light of the ENA meeting with 
Whalley and Baxter being moved to Thursday.  Please place the same priority 
on the ENA meeting that you would have placed on the Management Off-Site. 

Again, all are encouraged to attend with the same exceptions of business 
coverage and the same expectations of professional presentation.


Below is the message that Brian Redmond sent out.


Team:

Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave Delainey would like to combine the Asset 
Group floor meeting with the general ENA Employee Meeting that will be held 
on Thursday, March 9th from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the Hyatt Regency 
Hotel.   Therefore, our meeting today with Cliff, Greg and Dave at 2:00 p.m. 
has been 
canceled.  You are encouraged to submit questions in advance by e-mail or 
inter-office mail to michelle.vitrella@enron.com or EB 3645.

For those of you participating in the P&D Session on Thursday, I would like 
to start the session earlier beginning at 12:00 p.m. and then we will break 
at 3:00 p.m. to attend the Employee Meeting.  We will regroup after the 
Employee Meeting to summarize the results of the session.  Please let Kathy 
Benedict know if there is a conflict with this change.

I look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,
Brian


If you have any questions please call.

Thank You!
Yvette
