Carlos, 

Please call Linda and get everything set up.  

I'm going to estimate 4,500 coming up tomorrow, with a 2,000 increase each 
following day based on my conversations with Bill Fischer at BMAR.

Darren,

The attached appears to be a nomination from Vastar Resources, Inc. for the 
High Island Larger Block A-1 #2 (previously, erroneously referred to as the 
#1 well).  Vastar now expects the well to commence production sometime 
tomorrow.  I told Linda Harris that we'd get her a telephone number in Gas 
Control so she can provide notification of the turn-on tomorrow.  Linda's 
numbers, for the record, are 281.584.3359 voice and 713.312.1689 fax.

Would you please see that someone contacts Linda and advises her how to 
submit future nominations via e-mail, fax or voice?  Thanks.
