Subject : January Setup -- MOPS

Message Body :Specifically, meter 1373 has several deals set up and 6 of them are ranked 
10. These will not allocate properly as you know. Suggest you double check 
all the Industrials to ensure they are ranked correctly. January will then 
need to be re-nomed.
