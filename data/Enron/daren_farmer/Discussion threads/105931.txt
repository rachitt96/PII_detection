Message Body :Daren,

I am inquiring about the status of this contract.  This contract was 
forwarded to you on April 10, 2000 for review and initial.  I need to know if 
you still have possession of this contract or who has possession of this 
contract.


I need to have this contract routed for signatures and returned to the 
counterparty.


Thank you.
