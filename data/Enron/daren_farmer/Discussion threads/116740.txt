Message Body :For those of you who have been trying to access the PEP System, this morning 
or today, stop trying.  There are still problems with the system and it is 
unlikely that you will be bale to get in or submit your reviewers 
successfully.

INSTEAD, please submit your list of reviewers to Brenda via e-mail.  She will 
make any changes necessary and forward them on to the PEP Helpdesk.  They 
will then be responsible for entering your reviewers manually.

If you have any questions, please call.

Thanx!

It's that time of the year again - just earlier this year than last year!!!  
Please log into the PEP system, when it becomes available, and select at 
least five feedback reviewers.  The feedback is intended to reflect 
interraction throughout the organization.  For leads and managers and 
directors, please make sure you include at least one direct report.  The 
reviewers you select should be employees whom you have worked with frequently 
since 1/1/00 and whom can provide constructive feedback as to your 
performance.  Nothing prevents you from selecting more than 5 reviewers.  I 
will review them, and if I feel there are others whom should be added, I will 
do so.  ASSUMING the system becomes available soon, please complete your 
selection process by COB, Tuesday, 5/16/00.  I want to approve these ASAP, so 
we can get our request out early.  Turn around is critical.

The next thing I will need is a listing of your accomplishments for 2000.  I 
would like these by E-Mail by Monday, June 5, 10:00am.  Once again, the 
timeline is critical to the process, and is not negotiable.

Although we have reorganized the Risk group effective 5/1/00, I will still 
perform the performance reviews.  Mike, Steve will be responsible for your 
review. 

Let me know if you hav any questions or concerns.  Thanks for supporting the 
process and the timeline!
