Message Body :Daren,

There are two purchases at the above referenced meter for the 28th of Oct., 
1999.   Gas flowed without a purchase from the29th through the 31st.  Please 
let me know if we should be paying the swing parties(deal tickets117738 and 
120359) , or how I should allocate the volume.  

Thank you for your time and patience!!
