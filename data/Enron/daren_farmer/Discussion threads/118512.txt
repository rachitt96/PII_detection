Mary,

This is all the information that I have when Ami first looked at all the CES 
information.  It does not mention a processing agreement, but that does not 
mean that there isn't one.





Daren - do you know anything about a processing agreement for the Devon gas 
at the Gulf Plains plant as it relates to the CES acquisition?
