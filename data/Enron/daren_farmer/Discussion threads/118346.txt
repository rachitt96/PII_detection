Message Body :Hey man this is Stacy. I was checking out the HighSchoolAlumni website
tonight and I saw your name and thought I'd write ya. Man I can't believe
it's been this long. Last time I saw you was that night at A&M when you, me
and John Agee went out drinking and running over signs. I was living up in
Dallas for about 4 years but I moved back to MP about a year ago. I also got
married and had a little baby girl in since then too. Anyway I just wanted
to say hi. Hope I'm emailing the right person here. Mail me back man.


PS.. Maybe we can get Scotty T, Jim Richey, and us together for that fabled
camping trip.

Cya
