Message Body :I'll get with Brenda on February and Brian will be getting me March.  Ken 
Seaman should have be correct because I personally made him inactive on Feb 
15th (the final day of his last pay period . .. we couldn't do it his real 
last day because we had to allow that pay period to finish out so it would 
kick out a timesheet for him.)  The Specialist may actually be Ami because 
her title was incorrect for awhile (but we'll look at it to make sure).  

I'll keep you posted.

Yvette, 
Starting with March, all Labor Distribution reports will come through me, and 
I will distribute them.  Brenda should have received all of the Labor Reports 
for the RC's that report to her for February.  I say "should have" because 
they were supposed to be sent out by someone  else.  I will try get you a 
copy of the February reports and send them to you.
Hopefully in the future with me controlling the distribution, we will not 
have this problem.
Thanks,
Brian

Brian, 

Who do I talk to about getting Daren Farmer a Labor Distribution report. He 
needs to see what employees are hitting his RC.  I know that we have 
discussed this prior and soem Managers are receiving a monthly report but he 
is not.  Who can help us???

Thank you!
Yvette
