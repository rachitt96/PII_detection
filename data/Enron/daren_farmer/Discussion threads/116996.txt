Clarissa,
Per our conversation last week, we are unable to increase EC 254, SP 13 and 
WC 45(20) due to the Tennessee seal on the 800 leg.  This shall confirm the 
volumes will remain at first of the month levels until the seal is lifted.  
At that time, I will recalculate the changes and notify you of any changes at 
that time.

Thanks,
Steve
