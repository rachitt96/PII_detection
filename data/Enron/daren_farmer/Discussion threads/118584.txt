Message Body :  Bob/Bob, 

  FYI - Daren has let me know that, according to next weeks weather report it 
will be getting cold and possibly icy, Wednesday and Thursday 
  of next week.  The Texas Desk has reserved 15 rooms at the Hyatt in 
preparation of this Inclement Weather.   Please let me know if you think 
  the other regions should prepare in this way as well. 

   Wednesday the high is 38, low 32
  Thursday              high is 40, low 27



   Thanks! :  ) Heather
