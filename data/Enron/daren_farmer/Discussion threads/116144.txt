Subject : Support for Monthly Charges for Analysts on your RC report - Please Review

Message Body :As a follow up to my message last week on charges for Analysts, I am 
attaching the file that Financial Operations used to charge your RC with the 
$6,400 in monthly costs that I detailed below.  I have received a few calls 
and E-mails stating that some reclasses need to be made because you no longer 
have an analyst in your group.  The information used by Financial Operations 
to charge your RC was obtained from the Org Database.  Please review the 
attached files for January and February to ensure that the proper RC was and 
is going to be charged.  If you have any corrections, please contact Brian 
Heinrich at Ext. 5-7677 ASAP since journal entries will need to be processed 
by this Friday, March 3rd.

If you have any questions, please call me.  I just want to let everyone know 
that it is important that we continue to keep the Org Database updated as 
changes are made.  It is and will continue to be the source of headcount 
information for Energy Operations.  Thank you for your continued support in 
this process.

Subject: Monthly Charges for Analysts on your RC report

I wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for Analysts if you 
currently have or will have one in your RC for the year 2000.  The analyst 
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999.  In addition to the 
normal salary, benefits and payroll taxes, you will also be charged an 
overhead administration fee for the program.  You will be charged the 
following MONTHLY amounts for each analyst in the Detail Class code that I 
have indicated below:

Detail Class  Description   Amount
      1  Salaries and Wages                   $4,000
        552  Benefits                         774
        557  Payroll Taxes                         360
        820  Corporate Services                      1,266
    Total MONTHLY Cost                   $6,400 

The $4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not 
indicate what the analyst in your RC is paid.  This amount will not change in 
February as the $4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000.

The $1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program, 
including campus recruiting and office visits.

When you look at your RC report, you will see a line item labeled  "A and A 
Reclass" in each of the Detail Classes identified above.  Enron North America 
is invoiced by Corp. for the costs of all analysts.  Financial Operations 
makes a manual Journal Entry each month to charge the appropriate RC.  Please 
check your January 2000 RC report and make sure you were properly charged for 
the correct number of analysts you have currently.  If there are any errors, 
please let me know as soon as possible so that I can work with Brian Heinrich 
to have it corrected in February.  Please continue to check your RC report 
each month going forward.  Thanks.

If you have any questions, please call me.
