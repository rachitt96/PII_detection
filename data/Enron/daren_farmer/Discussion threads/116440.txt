Message Body :Stella,
It is very important  that King Ranch is accurately scheduled in the 
system.   Sitara should be updated
with any changes so that Daren can properly manage the Texas Desk position.  
Hopefully we have moved
enough off of your desk to allow  you to concentrate on King Ranch.  Too many 
discrepancies have been made
and it is very costly to the desk.    Robert can assist if needed.     
Thanks,    Pat
