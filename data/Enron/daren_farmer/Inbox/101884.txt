Brain fart on my part... You were long 90 contracts index during bid-week, so your index true-up should be 90 contracts by $.04 = $36,000... You are now buying less expensive index gas (index gas now worth $3.73 vs prior $3.77), which gives you the benefit... Add to that the weekend true-up of $.17, which gives you another $10,000...

Take away your physical new deals of $20K and you are left with the $24K p&l... O'Neal
