Message Body :The following name overlays were completed in GCP this morning.  I have been unable to update the report in Livelink, due to technical problems, which will hopefully be resolved tomorrow, May 14.  If additional information is required in the meantime, please contact me.

These changes are as a result of a merger between PanCanadian Energy Corporation and Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd., effective 04/05/02.  The combined entity was renamed EnCana Corporation.
