Hi,
 
The number is 281-370-7838.
 
I did not think of it, but without the pipe one has to balance  ones own, doesn't one. Of course the major problem was the people with HPL, not  the counter-parties. Who's doing that for you guys?
 
Jen came home for the Memorial Day weekend so we just bummed  around. Saw Pearl Harbor, watched a few DVD's, and ate way to much.
 
When you get time let us know about your "bad luck". I hope  Jake wasn't helping you too much.
 
I have been occupying much to much time with our new sound  system. We finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of Yamaha  stuff coupled to an equally large stack of Klipsch speakers. Awesome is the only  word to apply. I'm sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door. (It's  a young couple with a baby) (Not near as nice as the other young couple I  know).
Rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good.  :)
 
Stock market still sucks, but as long as it pays for groceries  and taxes we'll be OK.
 
I'm off to get Linda's gas guzzlin, environment ruining, SUV  washed and buffed. Then I must re-stock my CD-R's and load up on some more  music. You can see how well I'm utilizing my time in doing productive  things.
 
Later,
Ken
 
P. S. I thought WAHA was where all the pillaging of California  was taking place.
