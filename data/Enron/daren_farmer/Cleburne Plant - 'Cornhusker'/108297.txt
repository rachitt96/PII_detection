Message Body :Hi Darrin,

Rita has asked me to provide her with all the "deal numbers" associated for 
the Cornhusker (Tenaska IV Texas Partners) Deal.  When you get a chance, 
would you please send me those deal numbers.   

Even though I can print reports such as the "Deal Volume Tracking Report" to 
retrieve some of the deal numbers, Rita was concerned that there might be 
other deals set-up in Unify, which we don't know about.

Thank you,

Kathy  :  )
