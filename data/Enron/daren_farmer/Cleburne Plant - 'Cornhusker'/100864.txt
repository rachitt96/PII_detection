Message Body :Daren--The Cleburne Plant is consistantly pulling more than we are supplying..approx. 3.0 to 5.0 day------new current imbalance of (95.0) due Lonestar(based on Lonestar estimates).  Are you interested in payback?  maybe 10.0 a day?  Let me know and I will clear it with Lonestar.

Thanks,
Mark
