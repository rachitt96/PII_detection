Message Body :We need to change the demand fee on deal 384258 for Tenaska IV for 4/01.  The Williams invoice was not as much as the spreadsheet showed, so our expenses decreased.  Please change the amount from $2,979,909.91 to $2,862,531.95.  I have attached the revised spreadsheet.

 

Thanks,
Megan
