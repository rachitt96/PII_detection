Message Body :I have several changes to the demand fees for Tenaska IV.  Let me know if you have any questions.

For Dec 2000, we need to adjust the demand fee on deal 529856 to account for a volume change on the receipt side.  We overpaid Williams and are going to take our money back.  We then need to refund Tenaska IV.  Please change the demand fee from $878,330.63 to $918,566.13.

For Feb 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,341,675.50 to $3,438,325.95.  Tenaska IV owes us for the remaining expenses.  Also, please change the agency volume on deal 514353 from 45,000 to 45,067.

For March 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,591,791.50 to $2,653,694.95.  I have attached the March spreadsheet I received from Mark in case you want to see it.

 


Thanks,
