Message Body :I see the demand fee changes and the Williams price change.  That all looks 
great, but I still have a problem with the Apache prices.   For 10/00 and 
11/00, we have a price of 2.285 for deal 384247.  Apache billed 2.175 for 
both months.  Are we going to change the Apache prices?
