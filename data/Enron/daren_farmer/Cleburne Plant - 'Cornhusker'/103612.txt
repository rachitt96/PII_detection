Bad news.....the Cleburne imbalance is out of control.  You might want to start some payback to Lonestar.  Lonestar's estimates for the accumulative imbalance at the beginning of May was 140.0 due them, now I guess their actuals came in and now at the beginning of May shows 214.0 due them.  I am waiting to hear back from Lisa with Lonestar to see why there is such a big discrepancy.  Through the 16th, her updated estimates reflect an imbalance of 240.0 due them....the plant continues to overpull, our nom to the plant which is not all 45.0 due to Brazos' take.  

Let me know what you want to do.
