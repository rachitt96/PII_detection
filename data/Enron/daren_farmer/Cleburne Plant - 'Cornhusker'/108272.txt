Tenaska is indicating that the sale for July 2000 should be priced at $3.56.  
Could you confirm our sale price should have been $3.58?

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized 
through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers.

The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".

Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany 
mail.  (I received both invoices this week)

 I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.
