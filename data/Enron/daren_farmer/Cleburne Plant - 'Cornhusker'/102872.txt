Message Body :Darren:
Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 for June 2001 from $3,578,257.50 to $3,559,472.93.  Our transport expenses went down.  We are having some volume problems with this month, so we may need to change it again.  I'm trying to keep Kyle Lilly and Jim Pond happy on the GL side.

Thanks,
Megan
