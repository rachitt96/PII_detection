According to the contract brief I received, the 2.175 is a 1999 price.  I 
believe my pricing is correct.  Bob or Darren may be able your questions 
better.

I got an invoice for the gas we bought from Apache for Tenaska IV and they 
have a different price.  For deal 384247, we have a price of 2.285 and a 
demand fee of 0.457 for 25,000/day.  Apache is billing us at 2.175 with no 
demand charge.  Can you verify this price for me and let me know which is 
correct?

Thanks,
Megan
