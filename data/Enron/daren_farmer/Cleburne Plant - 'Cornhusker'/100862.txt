Message Body :We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.
