AP-College Station Texas----
Texas A&M football practice was delayed on Monday for nearly two  hours at Kyle Field. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room  happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery  substance on the practice field. 
Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while the FBI was  called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined  that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.  
Practice was resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not  be likely to encounter the substance again.
