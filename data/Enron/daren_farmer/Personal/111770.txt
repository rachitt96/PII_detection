I'll now be including Gayla on these e-mails because she has agreed to
write
brief profiles of each new family for the bulletin.

Here are the First Friends candidates from this week (please remember to
tell me what assignments you made so I can track that with my new member
data - Thanks!)

Jeanna Bent
8002 Fonthill Dr
Spring, TX  77379

(Champion Oaks)

Michael and Jeanna are both CPA's.  They have a 7-year-old son named
Mason.
Michael's company will be relocating to New Hamphsire in the fall, but he
does not want to move, so he will be looking for a new job soon.  Michael
was just baptized two weeks ago after studying with Gerald Bendele.  He
was
raised in a Catholic background.  I believe Jeanna has been a Christian
for
some time.
