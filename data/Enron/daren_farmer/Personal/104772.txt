Subject : NEON Discussion January 24

Message Body :Here is an idea for this week.? Next week Brad  Cox is planning on starting a 
discussion series based on the Experiencing God  study, that he will modify 
for teenagers to be used in NEON.? It will  probably consist mainly of 
questions similar to what you're getting this  week.? At this point in the 
semester your kids hopefully feel comfortable  with each other to go ahead 
and spring right into some Biblically relevant  discussions.? Make sure, 
though, that you do what is necessary for your  kids to connect with each 
other and with you as adults and to make visitors feel  at ease.? Spend time 
visiting together as a group, and then individually  with the kids after NEON 
is officially over with cokes and cookies.?  Remember that that the "before 
and after" is probably the most important aspect  of NEON.
