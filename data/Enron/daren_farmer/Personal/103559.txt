Message Body :Our CEO was contacted by a David Gardner, president of Gardner Energy in
Houston regarding a five-year package of gas.  I spoke to him only briefly
but did not get a good feeling about him or his deal.  Do you know of this
firm?  I was unable to pull up anything on the internet.  I suspect he's
just a marketer.

Don't spend any time on this.  I was just curious as to whether or not you
know of him or his firm.  Thanks.
