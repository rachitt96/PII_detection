Message Body :If you don't have Powerpoint installed, go to
http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Ppview97.aspx and download the
PowerPoint viewer.

Then you should be able to view the link at
http://my.servepics.com/pictures/attack.pps.

Again, if you are squeemish...don't bother looking at the slides.  It shows
