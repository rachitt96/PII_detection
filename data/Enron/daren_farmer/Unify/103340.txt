Message Body :
Desk Managers, 

I will be issuing a small laminated version of the attached list of contacts for escalation of Unify and EDI issues in a small laminated version.  The objective in putting Richard first on the list is to address any issues that are business related or education related prior to getting IT folks involved; thereby, freeing up our IT folks to work on programming fixes and enhancements.  

<<EscalationProcedures.xls>> 

After implementation, if you feel these escalation procedures are not providing the level of support your desk requires, please let me know. 

Regards, 

Tammy
