I have attached a draft of the enhancement to automate the load of scheduled quantities.  Please review and provide your input by COB 10/10/01.  If you need to discuss this document,  let know and I will make arrangements to meet with you.  Once we get your input, we will issue an updated document and meet with IT to prioritize.
