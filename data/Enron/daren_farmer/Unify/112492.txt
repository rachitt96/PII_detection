Subject : Dave N out until July 5th

Message Body :I will be taking a sabbatical beginning any moment.  I have no control over 
the exact time; it may have already happened.  I plan to visit the mountains 
and the ocean.  They miss me. I miss them.  

Unfortunately, Enron requires employees to use vacation time instead of Inner 
Self time, so I will have to return someday.  Looks like July 5th.  I'm kind 
of bummed about it, but maybe by then I will have transcended to a new 
plateau of understanding.

In my absence, contact Milind Patil, x39247 for Unify performance issues.

Thanks for understanding, 

 The Persona Formerly Known as Dave  (the keyboard can no longer be used to 
spell my new name)
