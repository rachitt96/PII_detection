Message Body :The new SITARA to UNIFY bridge monitor is in production.

The monitor shows deals in error state (failed) or in queue to bridge 
(pending) - for deals going to UNIFY from SITARA.

You will find it under - Start - Programs - Trading - SITARA - SU Bridge 
Monitor.

You may need to load the Borland BDE v5.0 software to use this, if not 
already loaded. 

We enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool.




If deal is in an error state on the SITARA side - we have not sent it over to 
UNIFY.
If the deal in an error state on the UNIFY side - SITARA has sent it to UNIFY 
- however - it is in the UNIFY failed deal group.

You can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit.

The date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal. 
Start Date and Stop Date - are begin and end date of deal.

SITARA deal ID - as well as - EOL deal ID.

Indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal.

If you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the STATUS = P 
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions 
(awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal).  If you 
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have 
access to multiple desks. 

You can hit the refresh button to re-query the data - or set the auto refresh 
on the tool bar.

We did not build Filter by Business Unit for multiple reasons:
- the expense to build the filter.
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing.
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it.
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error 
state - once Petro Can/Suncor/Sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
  number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column. 
- If you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel 
feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel.

If you have any questions or problems - please call the SITARA hotline.
