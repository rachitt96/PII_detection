Subject : Winter Cap for Entex

Message Body :When you get allocations for January, we need to look at daily volumes for 
Transaction #1. Towards the end of the month, Entex was approaching its Jan 
winter cap volume of 550,000/day. If the daily volume for Trans #1 comes out 
greater than 550, the excess must be charged at GD+10. The numbers thus far 
show that they did not exceed 550. However, the allocated volumes tend to 
differ. 

Thanks,
AC
