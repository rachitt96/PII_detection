Daren,

 I want to thank you angain for your heart-felt generosit y.  The JDF walk is 
this weekend, and we are supposed to turn in our money by wednesday for Enron 
to match these amounts.  It is to this end that I request you make your check 
payable to "JDF" for the $25 pledged as soon as possible, and call me to let 
me know when I can stop by and pick it up. 

Thanks again!
