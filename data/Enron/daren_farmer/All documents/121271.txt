Subject : Unify passwords will be reset under Sybase 12.0

Message Body :All,

When we convert Unify to Sybase 12.0, all passwords will get reset to 
"houston".  Once you login to Unify you will have to change you password.  
This is an unavoidable side affect of migrating to Sybase 12.0.

Thanks,
Chris
