Message Body :Hey! I'v almost got the curtains finished.  Been so busy, everything's so
busy this week.  I probably won't get them mailed until Mon.'cause I have to
borrow a car from someone at work in order to get to the Post Office in time
before it closes in this hick town, & everyone goes home early & don't want
to wait around on Fri.  But I'll get them there asap.  They won't have
buttons, 'cause Tonya didn't know what kind she wanted when we got the
material. We'll be at competition all day Sat. at Plano & then at Shane's
Sat. night. Home Sun. sometime.  Wish ya'll could be with us.  Lacy is in 3
different routines--she made all of them.On front row.Maybe I can see her
ok.  Gotta go. Let me know if you get this. My comp. is kinda messed up.
Give Cole a hug. Love, Ma
