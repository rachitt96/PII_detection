Subject : Re: Maps for Enron.com

Message Body :Yes, we can add maps at a later time.  I expect to do a phase two later this 
summer to revise the content and make adjustments.  However, I make no 
promises as to how long it will take to integrate a new map at a later time.  
Phase two will be done, but a schedule has not yet been created for it.
