Bob,

HPLC purchased wellhead gas from the producer listed below for the specified 
period.  This production was purchased on a "spot" basis and a deal ticket 
should be created and entered into sitara based on the following information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price    Period

Coastal Oil & Gas Corp   4179   4,500mmbtu/d   85% IF/HSC    9/1/00-9/8/00 

Additionally, this are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM 
Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

Thanks,
