Message Body :I guess he won't be by as he knows it all now. And if he doesn't it will be 
my fault for not teaching him correctly. 

Supplemental to our conversation yesterday; I would come back to help you 
with a project or job for which you needed any of my talents. If it involves 
working with this guy ---- FORGET IT.

P.S. I have not taught him well as things are still being done incorrectly.

 I simple want you to know personally that I appreciate the time spent with 
you.  Ken, you have taught me well.
 I have the confidence to carry the torch and thanks again for being 
available.

The day you have long awaited is arriving. 

I will be in the office next Monday and Tuesday, the 7th and 8th. If you have 
any questions or situations you would like some help with that will be your 
last chance.

I will then leave you in peace.
