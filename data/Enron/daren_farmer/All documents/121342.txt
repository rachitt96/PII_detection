Weekend of August 26 ) 28, 2000


Saturday:

£ Celanese Bayport meter 8018 was ramping back up.  Total nomination of 
35,000 in Mops was pathed ) transmitted nom to Pops and confirmed.
£ Costilla , meter 9687 was still down 4,000 due to wellhead production 
losses on Friday, expected short into the first of the week, possibly longer, 
may need to fish the hole to bring the well back up.
£ Costilla Pilgreen ) Running high H2S, causing our valve to shut-in 13,000 
MM,s  (we changed our specs at the valve to accept 8 parts per mil for 30 
minutes last week, per Jill Zively).  Louis Dreyfus was diverting the well to 
another pipeline, per the contract that gas has to come to us or be shut-in.  
We got the well back on Saturday afternoon, and all was well.
£ All meters were updated in Pops for Satuday,s gas day.
£ Christy w/ PG&E called with Cuts into the Hub:
Volume of 16,495 cut to 1,799
Volume of 15,000 cut to 6,845
£ Meter 1505 lost two compressors and was about 2,000 short to us.  This 
issue was resolved.


Sunday:

£ Shell meter 1060 cut back from 35,000 to 15,000; Shell lost two units.  
Also, seeing meter 1394 which dels to Shell back down from 10,000 to 5,000.
£ Patty called re: the EPNG cuts, found out late afternoon that they are PCC, 
Pipeline Capacity Constraints, at the IVALEROW meter into PG&E.
£ Joey Stanton with Duke called regarding some new production coming up.  He 
wanted to sell it into HPL at Lonestar/Katy for Sunday and Monday.  Paged 
Darren, we took the gas, it needs to be priced today.  Duke let me know that 
they would flow at a rate of 25,000/hour, and should average approximately 
12-15,000 for the day.  Mark McCoy is working on getting a good meter total 
from Lonestar for Sunday, we need to get the deal in Sitara and confirm 
today's gas day as well.
£ Regarding PG&E, I do not have final Cycle 4 numbers (they come out around 
9pm on the gas day).

All in all, it was a pretty good weekend, and an educational one.  Gas 
control did a great job communicating and assisting to resolve issues.  
Please check all meters impacted to make sure that I Pop,d and Mop,d 
correctly. 

Thank you,

Mary Jane
