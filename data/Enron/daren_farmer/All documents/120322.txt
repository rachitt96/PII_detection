Subject : Conference for New enron.com

Message Body :Ladies & Gentlemen,

Please review the attached powerpoint presentation for our conference call on 
Thursday at 1:30 CDT.  The slides demonstrate the new look & screenflow 
proposed for enron.com as well as the text descriptions proposed for each of 
your business areas.  I will walk through this during the call to elaborate 
on the new design & how a visitor would navigate through enron.com to get to 
your individual business units.

I am looking for your explicit approval of the content paragraphs before this 
is shown to Stan Horton and other CEO's/Chairmen around the company.  This 
new look & content will replace today's enron.com by June 30.  I look forward 
to speaking with you soon.
