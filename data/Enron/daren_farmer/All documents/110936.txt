Message Body :
Did you survive bid week?
 
I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff left?
 
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
 
Gotta run. Almost have my *&^%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big changes. It sucks.
 
Later,
Ken
