Bob,

Jennifer Martinez struck a deal with Hesco (who apparently is the marketer of 
GMT's production) to purchase gas at meter 6063 in the name of HPLC.  Please 
create and submit a "spot" ticket in sitara based upon the following 
information:


Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price    Period

HESCO Gathering Oil Co.  6063   300mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.095 6/1 -
