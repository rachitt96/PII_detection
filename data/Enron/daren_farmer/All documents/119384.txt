Message Body :Tom,

The Thamm #1 well came on line for first delivery on Tuesday, 2/1/00 at 
6:45pm.  The contract calls for first of the month pricing.  Please create a 
one month baseload firm deal ticket in sitara based upon the following:


Counterparty    Meter    Volume   Price

Union Gas Corporation   9823    500mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.10



Susan will create a firm ticket for the term of the deal once our geologists 
have gathered enough data to forecast the reserves for this well; at such 
time, we will request that this ticket be zeroed out.

If there are any questions or concerns please give me a call.

Thanks,

vlt
