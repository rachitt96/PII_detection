Have spoken w/ both gas controls (HPL/DEFS) and will agree with your
17,500.

We disagree.  We show 17.500, that was 0200 to 0900 @  60 rate which equals
17.500

Per my gas control, Tufco went to 60,000 at midnight and reduced to 45,000
at 3:00 am due to PG&E having a compressor down.  Nom rate calculated on 3
hrs at 60,000 and 6 hrs at 45,000.  Please let me know if you have heard
differently.
