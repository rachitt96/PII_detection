Subject : Re: Meter 0980438 - Acock Production ??????

Message Body :I have spoken with Clem, this meter is now "non-allocatable", not unlike 
meter 8751on Big Cowboy.  This meter needs to be set up as a Receipt Meter 
attached to the Gulf Energy 27-009-08 agreement.  This gas began flowing on 
7/7/00, so deal ticket 380710, which begins 9/1/00 will need to be backed up 
to July to account for the purchase of this production.

Bob:  Please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that I can have 
Fred set up accounting arrangements on Gulf Energy.

Fred:  Can you please determine whether or not we have paid CCGM for this gas?

Once again, thank you all for your assistance.

Mary
