Ami,
      Sorry that I haven't followed up yet, but we are in the middle of
implementing SAP (which I'm sure
  you have heard about), and haven't had time to put the sample report 
together.
What I have at
 present is a report from our SCADA system that must be run manually each day,
to get a report of
Yesterday's Volumes, beginning and ending at 7:00 a.m.  The problem is, until 
I
can revise it, the
report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers, and I need to
create a new one with only the
HPL stations.  I also want to set it up for automatic creation, to run at
approx. 8:00 a.m. daily.  It would
then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board, such as 
is
currently being operated
by George Perrine.  I will be coordinating this effort with George in that
regard.  Until I have completed the
entire task, however, I will try to send you a daily (5 days per week) report
created manually, showing the
previous day's volumes for our monitored HPL stations.  I am shooting for
starting this tomorrow.
     I have also been discussing this with Royal Edmondson of our Gas Supply
Dept., and he wants us all
to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information 
between
all interested parties.  He
will be getting back with you on this.
