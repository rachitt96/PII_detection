Message Body :Deal # 547201

Texas General Land office has called and is disputing that this sale is a 
part of the month exchange deal for transport.  
Do we have the name of the trader at Texas General Land Office that did this 
deal with us ?

The sale was for 01/01-01/31 for 99,200 mmbtus at $9.82.

Thanks - Katherine
