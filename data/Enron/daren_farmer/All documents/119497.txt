This note serves as a reminder and a request.  

The new SITARA risk assignment release is scheduled for the weekend of 
February 19-20.
There are 4 demos next week detailing the changes for the new risk assignment 
release.
To date, we have not received sign up requests from any of the traders or 
logistics personnel.
The changes in this next release are major.   It is highly recommended that 
everyone who deals
with SITARA physical deals with risk assignment attend on of these demos 
before implementation.   

This release involves the transformation of every deal with risk assignment 
to include the following new
linked hedge deal types: swaps, options, and annuities.

I cannot stress enough the significance of these changes and the 
transformation of the existing deals.

Please make every effort to have your regional teams attend one of the 
following demos.

DEMO TIME SLOTS:

WHEN: FEB 16TH  - 1:00 - 2:15 
  FEB 16TH  - 2:30 - 3:45
