Bob,

HPLC will be purchasing wellhead gas from the producers listed below for the 
production month of August.  This production will be purchased on a "spot" 
basis and deal tickets should be created and entered into sitara based on the 
following information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price    Sitara Deal #

Whiting Petroleum Corp   6523   200mmbtu/d   91% IF/HSC   348374
Engage Energy US, LP   5923   775mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.24  348390
Engage Energy US, LP   5848   240mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.24  348396

Additionally, this are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM
