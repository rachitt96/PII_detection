Subject:  Nom 5/1 (revised) - Eastrans

My understanding is that we have been cut for the 1st on HPL's transportation
to 8,000 MMBtu/d.

Therefore, we are reducing our nom for 5/1 and following to 40,800 MMbtu/d.

The redeliveries are as follows:

7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley
8,000 into PG & E
25,000 to HPL's cartwheel agreement at Carthage

For DEFS' info, we will have 3,720 MMBtu/d available
at the tailgate of Carthage for sale.
