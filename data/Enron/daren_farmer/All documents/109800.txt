Mary Jo,

Thanks for the update.  Regarding the notice provision of 6 business days
prior to the close of business on the last business day of the month prior
to selected month,  does that mean we need to give you notice for December
by Tuesday, November 21st at 5:00 PM or Monday, November 20th at 5:00 PM
assuming the 23rd and 24th are holidays?
