******************************************
Details:
We are excited to announce the launch of The EnronOnline Games on Friday - 
September 8, 2000 (tomorrow).  All EnronOnline customers with an Execute 
access to EnronOnline, and all the internal users of EnronOnline (Enron 
employees) will be able to participate in this competition.  The objective of 
these games is to build greater community around EnronOnline and to provide 
our users with additional services and some fun competition for cool prizes.

The Game:
The Game will be structured around the Olympics games being held in Sydney 
between Sept 15-October 1, 2000 (please note that we are advised against 
using the word Olympics when talking to our customers re. the game and as 
such, would rather use "The EnronOnline Games").  Participants can select any 
or all of the five countries allocated from a random draw as their pick.  Any 
country that was not selected by the participant in the first draw, will be 
replaced by another randomly allocated county in a second and final pick, 
ensuring that the participant has their full portfolio of five.  These 
selections have to be made by 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (midnight, 
Greenwich Meridian Time).  That is, the morning BEFORE the games are played 
each day.  Points will be accumulated for each gold, silver, or bronze medal 
won by the selected country.

Prizes:
Enron Employees:  Winning participants from within Enron will be awarded 
prizes as well.  These winners will not be competing for the customer prize 
pool, but will be eligible for a separate set of prizes, as detailed below.

First Prize:  $1,000 to $2,000 range (portable DVD player, digital camcorder, 
etc.).

Second Prize: $1,000 to $2,000 range (portable DVD player, digital camcorder, 
etc.).

3-10 Prizes: An assortment of smaller prizes.

from the customer pool and are as follows:
