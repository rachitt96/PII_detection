Mary,

We have a 90,000 MMBtu/d first of the month nomination against our term
baseload contract and a 20,000 MMBtu/d spot swing contract for January. I
assume that the 105,000 MMBtu/d demand request would be allocated 90,000
MMBtu/d against the baseload contract and 15,000 MMBtu/d against the spot
swing contract.
