 I am completing the last of 3-worksheets{1- Julie M. & 2- Ken S.} today and 
will distribute them  once I finish.
 Sorry for the delay but  various office & system issues contributed to the 
delay.

I am referring to Ken Seaman's file which provides additional information.  
We definitely need Ken's
File completed by Aug 1st. and distributed to our group, Daren Farmer, and 
Gary Hanks.  Both files should
be completed and can be linked on duplicate information.    Thanks,  Pat

I am confused. What file do you want me to update;   Julie Meyers file or Ken 
Seaman file ?
  Both files  provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support 
groups.
  To  prepare both files I feel is a duplicate of my efforts .  Please let 
know if you want both files updated
   and the approximate time table for completion.

Robert, 

Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at 
o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...  There is one file for each 
month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be 
distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.
