Subject : Change in SCADA Server to NAHOU-SCADA2

Message Body :The name of the SCADA server has been changed from ECTHOU_SCADA1 to 
NAHOU-SCADA2.

If you have a personal Excel spreadsheet that obtains data from the SCADA 
server using NetDDE, you will have to edit the spreadsheet.  Change the old 
name to the new name.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please call 34200.
