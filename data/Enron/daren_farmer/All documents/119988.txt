Don't we have an OBA at this point now?

Daren,

I know it's first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71 
dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (Sitara #213005) doesn't cover these 
two days.

Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in Sitara so that I 
can clear my exceptions for Volume Management?

Thanks
