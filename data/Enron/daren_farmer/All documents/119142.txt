Message Body :As of January 2000, I have taken over scheduling all "Industrial Accounts" 
without the assistance of 
   Kenneth Seaman.

   I want to thank Ken for all of his efforts during our training period.
 
  Ken has help me feel confident  to continue this responsibility with 
little, if any,  assistance from himself.
 Thus,   please forward all correspondence to me directly in the future.
