Albrecht #4 Well
Meter 098-4179, Goliad Co., TX  

In regards to Meter 098-4179 the following information is what I have been 
able to determine from the information available to me.

To your questions:

1. Cannot determine who owns this meter.  I will contact Molly Carriere on 
Monday when she returns.

2. HPL has a fifty (50) ft. easement at this location which does contain 
language for appurtenance rights within the 50'.

3. I pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during 
Project Rock and it does not contain a  Facility Agreement so I am assuming 
one was not    located.

Hope this helps.

Debbie,

Meter 098-4179 is located at sta. plus 40+85 on Align. Dwg. HC-1130-18-H in 
Goliad Co., TX.  In connection with the Facility Agreement request below, we 
need to know the following:

1.  Who owns the meter, HPLC or the operator?

2.  Do we own an easement and an access right of way to the meter station?

3.  Is there, to your knowledge, a Facility Agreement in place covering this 
meter?  We cannot locate such an agreement in our records.

Thanks.  George x3-6992

Albrecht #4 Well
Meter 098-4179, Goliad Co., TX

Shawna,

Attached is a Contract Preparation Request for a Facilities Agreement for the 
Coastal Oil & Gas Corporation Albrecht #4 well to be attached behind existing 
meter 098-4179 on the Meyersville - West Mission Valley lateral (1130) in 
Goliad Co., TX.  

Of particular note:

Coastal has acquired 3 previously drilled wells subject to HPLC contract 
96008903 behind Meter 098-4179 from Sierra 1996 I Limited Partnership and 
M.J.G. Inc., as Seller,s Representative for Sierra effective 3/1/2000; the 
Legal Department has prepared and is currently circulating a Ratification and 
Consent to Assign Document to reflect this transaction.

We have been unable to locate an existing Facility Agreement for the 3 
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such Agreement exists.

The Facility Agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations 
to be made to existing Meter 098-4179 to install an H2S monitor and necessary 
valving to allow HPLC to accept gas from the newly drilled Albrecht #4 well.

Once the H2S monitor has been installed and the Albrecht #4 well is ready to 
flow, we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the Albrecht #4 well only 
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc.  The Albrecht #4 will not be 
covered by 96008903, nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be 
subject to the spot gtc. 

Coastal will reimburse HPLC $39,600 for the cost of the installation.

Subject: Coastal Oil & Gas Corporation
Albrecht #4 Well
Meter 098-4179, Goliad Co., TX

Lal,

We intend to attempt to connect  about 4,000 Mmbtu/d of new production from 
the newly drilled Coastal Oil & Gas Corporation Albrecht #4 into the 
westernmost end of the Meyerville - West Mission Valley 6" Lateral (1130) on 
the Mission Valley System 485 in Goliad and Victoria Counties behind a 
existing meter 098-4179.  Coastal intends to add an incremental 1,000 Mmbut/d 
each day for four successive days; in May, 2000, the meter flowed about 960 
Mmbtu/d of 3.36% CO2 gas.  

The content of the Albrecht #4 gas according to the Field Gas Analysis 
prepared by Coastal Oil & Gas on 7/1/00:

Nitrogen 0.1124%
CO2  2.7224%
Methane 87.8390%
Ethane  6.1200% 1.628
Propane 2.0682% 0.567
Isobutane 0.3420% 0.111
n-Butane 0.4153% 0.130
Isopentane 0.1269% 0.046 
n-Pentane 0.0904% 0.033
Hexanes 0.1634%    0.069
Heptanes Plus 0.0000%    0.000
    2.584

Can HPLC accept this gas?

Pat,

Coastal has verbally advised that the Albrecht #4 well contains more than 
HPLC's permissible H2S content at the wellhead; the Albrecht #4 H2S content 
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 Mmbtu/d behind 
meter 098-4179, the Miller-Albrecht Unit #1-A and the Hoff Heller Gas Unit 
#1A & #2D.  Coastal further purports that for some time now it (and/or its 
predecessor, MJG, Corp.) has treated these three wells for H2S in a manner 
sufficient to reduce the H2S content delivered into HPLC to permissible 
levels.  Coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the H2S 
content of the Albrecht #4 to permissible levels before delivering same to 
HPLC.   In your opinion, should Coastal be forced to install an H2S monitor 
for this new gas prior to flowing same to HPLC?
