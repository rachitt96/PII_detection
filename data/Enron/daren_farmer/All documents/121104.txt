What is the source of the numbers for the fuel and what pipes are included?

Brenda wants to know why we flashed 24,302 MMbtu's with a value of $83,827 
and actuals came in at 12,511 MMbtu's with a value of $37,662.  Logistics is 
booking our fuel on 3rd party pipes.  Is there something Logistics needs to 
do to better estimate this expense?

Then the question would be:  where did we miss our projection?  Once again, I 
think we should include Rita in the reconciliation effort.

We flash fuel on 3rd party pipelines.
