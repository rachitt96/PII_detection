Subject: Timesheets

There will be brief 15 minute presentations offered in the lobby today 
walking you through,  step by step, entering your time in the new system. We 
will have a learning lunch next week answering any questions that you still 
have and walking you through it one more time.  The sooner you expose 
yourself to your Timesheet in eHROnline the easier this transition will be on 
all of us.

Thank You!
Yvette
