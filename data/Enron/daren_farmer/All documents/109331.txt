Subject : BUDGET QUESTIONAIRE - Update

Message Body :ONE MORE THING - NEXT YEAR YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR INHOUSE TRAINING - PLEASE
INCLUDE THESE CLASSES WITH THE OTHER TRAINING YOUR ARE SCHEDULEING.  IF YOU
GIVE THE CLASS, I WILL PUT IN THE COSTS (THANKS TO JEFF SORENSON FOR ASKING 
ABOUT
THIS)



I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS - WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING IN YOUR SALRIES - 

 DO NOT INCLUDE ANALSYST SALARIES!!!  

THESE ARE CHARGED AT A SPECIFIC AMOUNT TO YOUR RC, REGARDLESS OF THE
ACTUAL SALARY OF THE ANALSYT.  JUST GIVE ME THE TOTAL SALARIES OF ANY
NON-ANALYSTS, AND THE NUMBER OF ANALYSTS YOU HAVE.  I WILL PUT IN THE
SALARY ALLOCATIONS FOR THE ANALYSTS (ABOUT $4,000 PER MONTH).
