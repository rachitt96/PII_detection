I got an invoice for the gas we bought from Apache for Tenaska IV and they 
have a different price.  For deal 384247, we have a price of 2.285 and a 
demand fee of 0.457 for 25,000/day.  Apache is billing us at 2.175 with no 
demand charge.  Can you verify this price for me and let me know which is 
correct?

Thanks,
Megan
