Message Body :Daren:

During the period of 11/10/99 through 11/11/99, the above meter recorded flow 
of 1,613 Mmbtus.  There was no deal at this meter the month prior or after.  
Currently, Logistic has these volumes recorded to HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a deal to 
record these volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline or Logistics needs 
approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).


 ________________________________________________________________________
 APPROVAL to Write-off the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss

      OR

Thanks, Clem
