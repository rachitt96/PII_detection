Message Body :Subject: King Ranch Gas Plant- 12/2000 Election

HPL has elected to be kept whole with respect to processing during the month 
of December 2000 on its gas delivered from the Three Rivers Gathering 
System.  There should be no reduction for shrinkage and fuel at the plant for 
December 2000.


HPL will be kept whole with respect to ethane recoveries from the Big Cowboy 
gas being processed at the King Ranch Gas Plant during the month of December 
2000.  This election will reduce the shrinkage percentage from 20% of the 
inlet MMBtu's to 15% of the inlet MMBtu's.

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Thanks!

Blanca
