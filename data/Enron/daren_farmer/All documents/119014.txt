Message Body :I wanted to update you on those Phillips deals that the counterparty is 
saying are booked wrong.  I have left Gary L. a voice mail, but I have a 
feeling I won't be hearing from him.  So, we might not be getting an answer 
until next week on these deals.  The deals are; 131054 & 131048.

If I hear from Gary I'll let you know.  I'm hoping that they are ok.
