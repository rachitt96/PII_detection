 The swing ticket for Beaumont Methanol "meter #1428" {#249208} expired June 
30th.
 Bob Dorcheus indicated that  HPL should take the swing during July.
 
 Should  I expect another swing ticket to be negotiated for July ?
 
 Presently, the swing activity is hitting the "baseload" ticket {#314854}  
which is 15.0/day.
