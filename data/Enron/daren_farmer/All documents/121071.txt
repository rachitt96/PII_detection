Subject: New Production-Sitara Deals Needed

Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period
HESCO  Gathering Oil Co   9835   600mmbtu/d    96% Gas Daily less $0.14   
6/10 - 7/31
Samson Lone Star Limited 9845   3000mmbtu/d  100% Gas Daily less $0.10 7/21 - 
7/31

Winn Exploration Co., Inc. 9847   800mmbtu/d  100% Gas Daily less $0.13 7/25

          (for fuel use less 3.35% of del vols)

FYI, Susan has created and submitted committed reserves firm tickets for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of August.  Additionally, 
these are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.
