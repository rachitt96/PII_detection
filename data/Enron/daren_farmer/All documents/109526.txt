Message Body :As a reminder, today is the deadline for completion of the OPM Survey.  I am 
including the body of the email sent Monday in this regards which includes 
the reference document and the link to the survey.  Thanks for your help and 
hard work in this matter.


OPM SURVEY EMAIL SENT EARLIER:

As communicated to you in an email dated September 19, 2000, we have 
developed an easier and more efficient method of handling the Operations 
Pricing Model hours survey using Microsoft Access.  The NEW & IMPROVED survey 
is ready for your input for the month of September.

What to do:

1)  Attached is a reference document that lets you know the purpose of the 
OPM Hours Survey, prerequisites to using the tool, helpful hints and contact 
information.  Please open and read.

2)  Click on the attached link to access the OPM Survey.  Please select "OK" 
at the warning message that appears and continue on to the database.  If you 
have any questions/comments, please contact Suzanne Nicholie at Ext. 5-7341.

The OPM team is available to support you while using this new tool.  During 
the next couple of days, one of the OPM team members will be contacting each 
of you to see if you need help or have any questions.

We are asking for a quick turn around of the completion of the survey and 
although it is month end, quarter end and the planning process is near 
completion, please complete the OPM Survey using the database by end of day, 
Friday, October 6.

Thanks, 

James Scribner
