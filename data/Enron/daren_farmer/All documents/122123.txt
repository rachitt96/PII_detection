Message Body :I'm think I left out a detail - the 54,000 MMBtu for the three days Oct 21 to 
23 to Beaumont Methanol needs to be all priced at the base deal, not on the 
swing ticket.

Ladies and Gents:

On Sat Oct 21, HPL meter # 1428 had a malfunction, and started flowing at a 
very high rate, way over the nominated rate of 18,000/d  (Gas Control will 
confirm this).

Since Sat-Sun-Mon are all one gas day from a Gas Daily perspective, I told 
Gas Control to try to balance on Sun after the meter was fixed, by cutting 
back to a lower flow rate.

So we will need to do a special allocation for the three days October 21 - 
23, Saturday through Monday.  The three day total for the meter is 59,067 
MMBtu.  Beaumont Methanol nominated 54,000 MMBtu (i.e. 18,000/d for 3 
days).   We should allocate a total of 54,000 MMBtu to Beaumont Methanol for 
the three days, and the 5,067 MMBtu excess will be purchased by Brandywine - 
under Sitara # 484934 priced at Gas Daily HSC midpoint.

Please call with questions.

Thanks

Lee
