Subject: IMPORTANT!!! - TECO DEAL MEETING
Importance: High

Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss the TECO Frontera Deal on Monday, 
4/9 at 1:00pm (Stephanie - please arrange a conference room and forward 
information to all).  The TECO Deal will start scheduling Tuesday 4/10 for 
gas and power flow Wednesday 4/11 (sorry for the late notice but TECO wants 
to start ASAP).  If you do not have a copy of the contract and would like one 
please stop by my desk and grab one at EB3119b or print out the attached file 
below (Stephanie - please call and make sure all can attend the meeting).

I will give a summary of the deal and discuss with you what our obligations 
are.  Please read the contract as this meeting will not be a substitute for a 
thorough reading!

If you have any questions regarding this deal please call me at x3-4258 or 
page me 877-498-2166 if I am not at my desk.

Thanks for your assistance with this, - Mike
