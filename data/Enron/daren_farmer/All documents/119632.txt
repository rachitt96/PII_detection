Message Body :Daren, tell Tonya I called Edie last night about my W-2.  She said that they
got a new CPA & he has been told to mail them but hasn't.  She gave me the
amount that will show on the form.  It was $1500. I wrote it down at home
how much the net was, but I didn't bring it with me.  I had drawn some off
paying for Lacy's Tiger Doll stuff.  She said that she would tell him again
to get them mailed. Love, Ma
