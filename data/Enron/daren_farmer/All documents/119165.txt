Message Body :Subject: Rankings for Source/Destination
Please forward to logistics in your region......

Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the 
Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source 
rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the 
Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source 
side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry 
errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave 
Nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to 
find out if it would be something worth putting into production.
Thanks.
