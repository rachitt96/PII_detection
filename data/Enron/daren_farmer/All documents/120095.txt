Great.  Keep in mind - some people continue to confuse "Wellhead Portfolio" 
with "deals done by Producer Services."  All that should be in the wellhead 
portfolio is truly wellhead deals - not deals done by Greg Sharp's 
origination teams at competitive points.  Does that make sense?

I worked with Tom Acton last night to get the Wellhead Portfolio cleaned up.  
Tom had a sheet from Vance that we used to determine what deals should be in 
the portfolio.  I believe the portfolio is now correct.  The Sitara team will 
move the deals we identified today.
