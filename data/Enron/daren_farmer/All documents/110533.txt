Subject: FIRST DELIVERY - SAFARI PRODUCTION

Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period  Global No.
Safari Production Company 4594   400mmbtu/d  85% Gas Daily   2/2 - 2/28 
96057046


FYI, I will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of March.  Additionally, 
this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
