Subject : Review Texas Budget's Meeting : CANCELLED

Message Body :Today's Texas Budget meeting scheduled in 37C1 from 1-2 pm has been 
cancelled.  We will reschedule for early next week.  Hopefully this will 
allot each of you more time to review your portions of the budget and forward 
any questions you may want to have addressed. 

Thank You!
