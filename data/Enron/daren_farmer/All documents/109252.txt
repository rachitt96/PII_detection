Message Body :Daren,

I believe the best way to enter the fee into Sitara would be as a Demand fee 
in your example #1. 
If we do the fee this way, we will not  double up the volumes.

I have attached my spreadsheet for support:
THE MOST CURRENT WORKSHEET IS TAB #2 MARKED FINAL


Column G is the Over-Delivery quantity total is 17,278 mmbtus
Column S is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due HPLC  
$1,008.87 
Column T is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due the 
customer $519.73.

Thanks-
Katherine

Katherine, 

There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara:
1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.

2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I 
can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.

Let me know how you want to handle it.
