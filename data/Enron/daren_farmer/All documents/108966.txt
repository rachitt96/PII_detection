We will be testing the compressor station tomorrow morning.  Please be advised
if the
compressor cannot flow at a sustained volume it will be shut down and the
remainder
of the gas delivered at Busby will be considered an "incremental sale."  If 
you
have
any questions please call me at (713) 627-6202.

Thanks,
