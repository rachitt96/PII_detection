I will agree with the nom of 35,000 for the 1st.  We are experiencing
difficulties in downloading actual flow volumes from El Paso thus my gas
control has advised to use a flow rate of 35,000 for the 1st at this point
in time.  When we receive a more accurate measurement volume I will forward
to you.......
