Message Body :Hey guys,
You may or may not be aware, but I am taking over coordinating changes with 
Devon from Ami effective 7/1/2000.  These
are the first preliminary numbers from Devon.  I will send information for 
the 1st to all of you, but the changes will only go to
the pipes affected.  If you have any suggestions as to how this can be 
handled smoother, I would love to hear from you.  Also,
if anyone else needs these volumes, please let me know.  

Thanks for your help.

Attached are volumes available for sale on Devon's behalf for the month of 
July 2000.  I have made a note next to volumes and PVR's that are estimated 
and will furnish final volumes as soon as those are available.

Please let me know of any questions you have.

Thanks,
