The Carthage meters to report on EOL are listed below:

Tennessee				4603001
Texas Gas (Firm take away only)	4021021
Koch Midstream				4602001
Koch Gateway				4601003
Lonestar Header				4609001
Reliant					4082006
EPGT Texas Pipeline (PGE Texas)	4615002



There are a couple of meters in the hub, but the capacity is limited.  So, we should not list them.  Let me know if you have any questions or need additional info.
