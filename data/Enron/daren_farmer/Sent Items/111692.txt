Message Body :Hey, Ken

We had a good holiday.  Except for the trip back...it usually takes around 9 hours.  Last night it took 12.  Other than that everything was good.  Played a little golf (play may be too strong a word).  Watched a little football.  Our game with Texas was much better than I expected.  I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that.  And the OU game...I love college football.  It is so much more exciting than the pros.

Right now, I'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 3.85.  The big boys have been huddling quite a bit today.  I think that we are close to the end.  Layoffs should be announced tomorrow.

So, did you get the Christmas tree after the game?  20 footer?  We'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights.  Jake doesn't know what's going on.  But, Cole is all excited.  Everything he sees, he wants for "Chrimsas".  Knowing Jake, I will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down.  We'll see how it goes.

I hope you had happy holiday, even with the game.

Hi,
 
I know the stock sucks and things look  black, but I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving and a good trip.
 
At this 10 seconds there is 2 min. left  in the 1st quarter of the Neb./Colo. game and I have struck my colors.  Discretion being the better part of valor. My Aggie neighbor saw me taking them  down and just laughed ......... can you imagine?
 
We sure had the polls fooled for awhile  ............. and some of us more ignorant fans.
 
Ken
