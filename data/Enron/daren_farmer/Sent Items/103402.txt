Hey, Derrick

Thanks for the golf journal.  I'm looking forward to using it.  I've read through most of it already, and it looks easy enough to follow.  Golf is just like everything else, it just takes the disciple to practice and to practice correctly.  I know the tips will help me.  Keeping notes is good idea also.  Thanks, also for the golf towel.  I've got a round coming up tomorrow with a few guys from work.  Maybe I can sleep on the book tonight get a little advantage.  If I play like the last time (when David and I played over Christmas), I'll be buying balls from the club house.  Anyway, I hope you are doing well.
