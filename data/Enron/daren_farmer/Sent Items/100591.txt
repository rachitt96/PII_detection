On May 27th a lufkin Industrial market will go down by 5,000.  We are going to move this sale to Lyondell meter #   5045    .  The sales price will remain at Index minus $.12.   The sale will remain at Lyondell for approximately 2 weeks.     Since the screen has fallen about $1 this should be a good thing for us and a very nice thing for Entex to do for us.

Thanks,

Janet
