Three Rivers is scheduling PM on May 8 &9, this will involve shutting the
HPL point at Three Rivers for 2 full Gas days.  The nomination is 10.6 for
the month of May, we will makeup gas accordingly before maintance date or
after to balance for the month. Please let me know if you foresee any
problems with these dates, if no response back will go ahead and proceed
with scheduled work.
