Don't order any new equipment.  George can use the existing equipment in the space next to me. EB3210F.

Hello Daren,

I spoke with George Smith.  There is no new hire.  It is just him and he will be sitting right next to you.
(only part time) he is still keeping his desk over by me.  Ed Terry does not have any monitors avaliable.
Do you want me to order new equipment for George?  Let me know!

Thanks,
Brandee
