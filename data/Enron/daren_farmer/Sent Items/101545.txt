Howard comes from the volume management area, so I am sure that he knows the best way to handle the Shell buyback.  You should path the buyback that Howard set up.

Daren,
Howard set up the Shell meters to one buyback ticket - I haven't 
been pathing the shell meters. Before Aimee had it set up
individual and Howard said that it should all be tied to one.

Am I causing a problem by not pathing the meters now?
Should I go back and path the deal changes?
Thanks - Julie
