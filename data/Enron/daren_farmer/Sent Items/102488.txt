I would like to recommend a promotion for Mike Olsen.  Mike has been instrumental to the Texas Desk.  With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one scheduler with Texas experience.  Mike took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling).  He trained our new hire, Jay Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the Katy Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity at the Katy hub passed through the pipeline.  Mike used his knowledge of the Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effectively schedule our transactions.  Since June, Mike has handled the logistics activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasis, Guadalupe).  Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tracking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees through the hub).  Mike used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relationships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we scheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  Mike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority of my time with the trading.  Mike handled the daily logistics responsibilities.  He acted as lead, supervising and training Jay, our other team member.  Mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.  Mike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quicker than any of the schedulers I've seen.  In fact, he has gone from very minimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and processes to other people in the industry with more experience than him.  In short, Mike has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.  His abilities and hard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fulfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals.  Mike is a superior employee.  His knowledge, ability, and hard work are essential to the success of the Texas Desk.  Please support him with a promotion.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.  
Thanks.
