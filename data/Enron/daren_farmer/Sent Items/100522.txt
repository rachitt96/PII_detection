Message Body :Ed and Lauri, 

Jill Zivley is needing bids on various wells from EEX.  I understand that anything that is captive to HPL will be going with the pipeline after the sale.  So, you should probably quote the bids for any of this supply.  I have listed the applicable wells and some limited info in the attached spreadsheet.  Eric Boyt is working on the structuring of the deal. He may be contacting   you. He would like to get the bids to Jill by Friday.  Let me know if you have any questions.
