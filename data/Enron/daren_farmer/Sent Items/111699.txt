Message Body :Well, I'm here.  We are not trading.  Actually, we are just hanging around, playing games and shooting the breeze, waiting for the next news story.  It's really odd.  It really is sad seeing all the layoffs.  Especially, when I think of the $ the bigwigs carry home while the honest working people search for a way to earn a living.

Anyway, things are fine for me and the family.  I'd better go.  We've got a crossword competition starting.

I love it. A stock under a dollar that  trades 200-300 million shares a day. I've died and gone to heaven. It's more  liquid than natural gas.
 
To tell you the truth though I'd rather  lose this opportunity than have what has happened to all the employees. The  people upstairs, now that's another matter. Some of us warned of this in the  early stages, but we were shown the door. (Which actually turned out to be the  best for us)
 
Are you still trading? It must be a zoo  down there.
