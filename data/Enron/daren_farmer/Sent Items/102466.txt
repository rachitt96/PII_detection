Message Body :Hey Ken.  Well, I'm still here for now.  It's hard to leave.  We have all taken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the week before that.)  I'll only be here a couple of hours today.  But we had a great Christmas.  The kids have been so excited.  I made the mistake of getting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.  You can hear them all through our neighborhood.  The neighbors have already asked my what I was thinking.  Cole wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buzz Lightyear).  He got them all.  With each present, he kept getting louder and more excited.  Jake was primarily interested in in opening presents, he didn't care what was in them.  That kid gets more out of ripping things up and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.  In fact, the other day, Cole and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.  Cole likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.  So, he was working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being about eight feet tall).  Well Jake was chomping at the bit to run through it.  After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.  You should have seen his eyes light up.  You would have thought it was the biggest event of the year.  He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying "again, again."  It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.  My mom and sister came in the weekend before Christmas.  Tonya's parents and sister came in Friday.  With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downstairs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).  That was my first try with crown molding. It turned out ok.  Thank the Lord for wood putty.  So, we've been pretty busy.  But, it's been fun.

How was your Christmas?  Was Santa Claus good to you?  I guess your kids were in.  I hope you had a wonderful time.  I'm looking forward to Corn Boys bowl game.  Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.  Tonya's dad and I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of balls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.  It doesn't make much sense, does it?  But then again, most things that men do don't make much sense.

Later, 

Daren
