Daren,

Equistar will be bringing the Syngas plant back up effective May 10.  While the plant has been down, Enron has been buying the gas back at HSC - $.02.  Their load will come back up on the 10th and the price will be the fixed price on the deal of $5.75.

I appreciate your help on this.  Please let me know if there are any questions.

Craig
