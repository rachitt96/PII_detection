Message Body :Hey buddy!!  How's it going?  Hope you're working diligently to get that
stock price back up so that I can retire some day!!  Here's your Valero
plants quote.  Due to some operational issues, I can't quote term on the
Texas City plant.  If you want me to quote through December of this year, I
can do it for that term, just let me know.
