Message Body :Darren
I called this afternoon but you were out. I hope all is well with you with
respect to the recent events. Would you please call me regarding the
following two matters.

1) I am looking for a contact name and number for the person at Enron that
can help us get a GISB agreement in place. Our company went through a large
bank financing and we are going to be conducting commercial operations under
the entity known as ANP Funding I, LLC. Therefore, we would like to set up a
GISB agreement between Enron and ANP Funding I, LLC. Becky Kalmick works
with me and she is responsible for executing the GISB agreement. Would you
please let me know who we can speak with regarding the agreement. Also,
would you please give your contact heads up as to what we want to do. Please
note that I am dealing with Mary Cook in your company regarding the
execution of an ISDA agreement.

2) I would like to talk with you about the Hays Power Plant that connected
to Oasis Pipe Line and El Paso Texas Pipeline. We have firm transport on
Oasis from either Waha, Katy or Mid-State.

Thanks
Trey
