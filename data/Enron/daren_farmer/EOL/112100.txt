Hey Rob,

The Texas desk needs to create a new product that is similar to the Exxon Katy Phys product.  The product will be identical to the Exxon Katy product except for the location.

This product should be "for delivery at the tailgate of the Carthage Hub".

Please call with questions.



Thanks,

Eric
