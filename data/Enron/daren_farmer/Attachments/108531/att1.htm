<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The message below was sent Friday afternoon and 
came back with an incorrect address. Merry gave me the corrected e-mail address 
shown above.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>New developments. Merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has 
now been named.&nbsp;He is Brandon Aaron Byington </DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi there, Darren &amp; Tonya,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Merry and Doc had their new baby at 9:26 AM 
yesterday. No name yet. They are still trying to settle on one, so in the mean 
time, I'm just calling him "New Child" Byington.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4" long. Merry, 
Doc, and "New Child" are doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery 
(C section) so he says he was a bit shakey there a time or two.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Here are some digital camera pics I took when "N. 
C." was less thasn an hour old.</FONT></DIV>
