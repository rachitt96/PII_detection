Dear Daren Farmer,

One of the things we like to do here at Expedia is help you 
maximize your vacation dollar. Since accommodations are a 
big part of every vacation, we went to more than 1,200 quality 
hotels in more than 240 cities and negotiated hotel rates up to 
70% less than the average standard rates. We call these Expedia 
Special Rates, and it's all about saving you money. When you 
search for a hotel on Expedia.com, just look for the "Expedia 
Special Rates" icon and you'll know you're getting this special rate.

Right now, you can take advantage of an Expedia Special Rate 
at the brand-new Aladdin Resort in Las Vegas. This spectacular 
hotel just opened, and it features one of the largest collections of 
shopping, dining, entertainment, and gaming options available in 
Las Vegas. See what it's all about:

D.C. art show makes an "impression"
What do you mean your kids don't understand van Gogh, 
Matisse, Cezanne? Well, now's their chance to see these 
classics as more than just weird blobs of color, thanks to an 
art museum in Washington, D.C. that will help your kids get 
hip to impressionism.

Transport yourself to China from Portland
Stroll past stone lions and walls of greenery in a Suzhou-style 
garden, which is the largest of its kind outside of China. As you 
pass through the moongates of this Oregon Chinese garden, 
you'll feel as if you've been transported to China.

send to you in the Faretracker mail by sending you the lowest 
fares found by other Expedia customers.  Unfortunately,
we are unable to track fares for all possible airport pairs

Blue Nile Travel Advisory: Protect Your New Wedding Rings 
****************************************************************

Ensure your wedding rings return from the honeymoon:

* Make sure the rings fit snugly, so they're not lost during outdoor
activities. 
* Insure your rings before you go. Check to see that your insurance policy
covers lost and stolen items around the world.
* If you have to take your wedding rings off, put them in the hotel safe.

For education and guidance in selecting the perfect diamond, or for a gift
of jewelry to remind you of your trip for years to come, visit Blue Nile.
