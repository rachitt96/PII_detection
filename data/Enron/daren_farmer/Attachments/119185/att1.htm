<DIV><FONT size=2>I'm sitting here a bit disappointed and pissed.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Do you and Pat honestly believe it is "one man's word against 
another" on setting up the link builder by the 12th of the month?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>If so, why have I been saying something is wrong with some of 
the links for the last several days? And why did I work so late the first couple 
of days of each month setting up the links when&nbsp;I had so much 
time?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I'm not going to play this game with Mr. Lloyd. When he took 
the time to show up he was coached well in what was needed to be done, how to do 
it, and when to do it.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>This situation was entirely predictable. It is always "I'm 
about to do it" and it is always an "I thought you said............." 
situation.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>You know better. I won't be hung out again.</FONT></DIV>
