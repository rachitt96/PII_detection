<DIV><FONT size=2>Hi,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I figured something must be occupying your time other than 
answering non-business e-mail.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>You guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs 
each. ---- right? (chuckle).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>If Tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if 
you really have the time; lunch would be great. Just give me a call. 
<STRONG>Only if all the ifs really allow you the time.</STRONG></FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Is Craig ok?? I hope.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I would be glad to help with your sprinkler system. My 
sharpshooter is older than you are, but I imagine it is built a little better. 
My requested wages for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very 
cheap for you. I would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer. 
That would be free of charge.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I'm having a cable modem installed Monday. Supposed to be 
50-70 times faster than what&nbsp;I have. I do way to much jumping around to run 
off this slow modem. I can then dump my other phone line. Actually will end up 
spending less for more speed. I love technology.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Thanks for the info on the stock option. That is the closing 
price as of 1/18/00, which is right before the jump. very nice of management. I 
like to know the number to see what might be affecting the price.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Well good luck on the extra job and give our best to Tonya 
---- Not much longer to go...........</FONT></DIV>
