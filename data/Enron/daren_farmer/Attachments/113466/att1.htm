<DIV><FONT size=2>Daren,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Thinking about Robert's little memo yesterday and along the 
lines of pulling the marketing (Sitara) function back to your side of the fence 
I think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>It is obvious that several people are involved in changing 
tickets, pathing, nominating, and confirming the Industrials. This dissipates 
the knowledge base and the responsibility factor. It is a "Who's on First" 
issue.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>If the responsibility to ensure pricing, volume, and 
accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted, and in Sitara, is in 
your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness 
of Unify and POPS. I'm sure this would help volume management and client 
services immensely.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>As the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually 
feed more and more of the marketing function (Sitara) to the scheduling group in 
the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul 
picture.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I believe the current situation is too much, too fast, for 
scheduling to handle all at once. It has also created a situation where Robert 
seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered, but that he is 
the only person that should be involved in the Industrials. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I will support whatever direction you want to go on this 
issue, but if you and Pat leave things the way they are please explain to both 
Robert and Pat that others may be involved in the Industrial activity and that 
is quite alright.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Once again, thanks for listening.</FONT></DIV>
