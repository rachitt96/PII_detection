Gentlemen- We have reviewed the AEP Corpaorate Guaranty and have provided a
redline of the document to reflect our comments.  We were not sure if we
should be dealing with Dan or Jim so we sent it to both.  You can either
call Byron Gannaway at 9972) 628-2751 or Phil Schnorbach at (972) 628-2750
with comments or questions.  We would be happy to wrap this up on Friday if
possible.

Phil Schnorbach
