Message Body :Daren,

KCS wants to take their nom down from 6,500 to 5,700 on the gathering and increase the Texaco transport by the same volume at meter # 9658 beginning today.  Are you okay with the change?

Bob

Sorry about the confusion on the dates between the subject line (correctly
reflected) and the body of the letter (incorrectly reflected)...the change
for the "shift" between Texaco and KCS should be March 28, 2001.

This is a revised Josey Ranch nomination for the month of March 2001.  The

			   5,700	MMBtu/day for KCS Resources
(800 MMBtu/d decrease)
		   2,000	MMBtu/day for TEXACO
(800 MMBtu/d increase)
		   7,700	MMBtu/day Total (assumed Btu factor of 1.083
