Message Body :Daren,

HPLC is purchasing gas from the following list of producers.   This 
production is currently being purchased on a spot basis and deal tickets 
should be entered into sitara for the follow:

Counterparty    Meter   MMBTu/d    Price
 
Engage Energy US, LP   5839   600     100% less $0.18
Engage Energy US, LP   5848   500     100% less $0.18

Whiting Petroleum   6523   500     ???


Additionally, I asked Carlos to search sitara for what would be essentially 
be a spot ticket for the incremental volumes delivered to meter 9610 (Cage 
Ranch) for the production month of November.  I've received executed paper 
from Coastal documenting a purchase price of 100% of Gas Daily less a GPM 
sliding scale.  Please confirm whether or not a sitara ticket has been 
generated.  If not, please use this e-mail as a request to do so.

Thanks,
