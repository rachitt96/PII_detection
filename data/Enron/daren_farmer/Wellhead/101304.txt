Questions based on the information in the Facilitation by Location Report:

1.  Meter 9643 HGPL/HPL - Stratton, Tejones Operating Corporation, sitara 266970:  Should this purchase be at meter 9638, FREEMAN PROD-MAXINE FIELD in Trade Zone 18?

2.  I presume we are not counting BOTH Meter 9848 NORTH PADRE ISLAND BLK8 and Meter 9862 LEHMAN/SPINNAKER ONSHORE.  Isn't this the same gas?

3. Meter 3536 SEAHAWK/A-S (MAT PLT 520), EOG Resources, sitara 725391:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

4.  Meter 6884 PGTT JUNCTION 16" LEASE, Comstock Oil & Gas, Inc. and Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Onshore L.P., sitara 125899 and 132975:  Comstock's volume should exceed Kerr-McGee's volume, and together the two volumes should be approximately 73,000/d.  Currently, Comstock's volume is only 8,600/d and Kerr-McGee's volume is 25,000/d.   We look about 38,000/d short.

5.  Meter 639 HANNAH NASH, Coral Energy Resources, L.P., sitara 659998:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

I'm looking at about 10 other old deals that I think should be in for May, but aren't.  In addition, I'm adding in the new deals that will flow in May.  I'll be done by noon.

George
