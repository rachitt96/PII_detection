Tom/Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty			Meter			Volumes		Price				Period		Global No.
HESCO Gathering Co., LLC	9876			85mmbtu/d		100% GD less $0.17		3/13 - 3/31	96057368

FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
