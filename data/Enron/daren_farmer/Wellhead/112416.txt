HPLC will be purchasing wellhead gas from the producers listed below for the 
production month of October.  This production will be purchased on a "spot" 
basis and deal tickets should be created and entered into sitara based on the 
following information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price    Deal #      

Whiting Petroleum Corp   6523   200mmbtu/d   91% IF/HSC   438322
Engage Energy US, LP   5923   775mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.24  438332

Additionally, this are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM
