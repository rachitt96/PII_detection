Message Body :All,  

Please note that for May 2001, Crosstex Energy Ltd. will be paid the base contract price (IF/HSC - $0.10) under Contract 96048744.

As this is the Base Contract Price in the term agreement, no confirmation will be sent to the customer confirming the deal (we will only confirm when they elect Gas Daily Pricing).

Please adjust Sitara as necessary.

Thank you, 
Melissa
