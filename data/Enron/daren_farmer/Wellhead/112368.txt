Subject: New Production-Sitara deals needed

Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Deal #  Meter   Volumes  Price    Period
Cokinos Natural Gas Co.   327963  9842   2,800mmbtu/d    96% Gas Daily    7/6 
- 7/31
Upstream Energy Services 327964  9844       150mmbtu/d  100% Gas Daily less 
$0.14 7/8 - 7/31

FYI, Susan will create and submit committed reserves firm tickets for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of August.  Additionally, 
these are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
