Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period  Global No.
Wheeler Operating  9879   800mmbtu/d  85% Gas Daily   2/17 - 2/28 NYA

FYI, I have created and submitted a committed reserves firm ticket for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of March.  Additionally, 
this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
