Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty			Meter			Volumes	Deal #	Price				Period		Global No.
Suemaur Explor & Prod		9881			1300mmbtu/d	709716	100% GD less $0.10		3/22-3/31	96058314

MSLATX P/L Company		9880			2000mmbtu/d	709721	100% GD less $0.25		3/27-3/31	96058031

	
FYI, I have created and submitted a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
