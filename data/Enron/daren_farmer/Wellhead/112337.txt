Bob, 

Go ahead and accept the nom revision.  I believe that this is with PGE, not 
El Paso.  How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?  I f they have a 
higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom 
there.  In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as 
possible to what we have in the system now.

Daren,

Charlotte Hawkins is having trouble confirming the volume of 5,733 with El 
Paso.  El Paso will not confirm the volume that high.  EOG revised their 
nomination as follows:

C/P Name Meter #  Orig Nom Rev Nom

EOG Res. 6296  5,733  2,300

Will you approve revising the volume in Unify down to 2,300?  Please advise.  
Thanks.

Bob
