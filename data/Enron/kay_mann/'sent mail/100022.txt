Message Body :Hi Cheryl,

I'm looking for the executed version of the contract with Westinghouse for 
the 501D turbine, which I believe was originally headed to Panama.  ENA is 
looking to use it in a project or two, and I need to give a look.  An 
electronic version would be fine.

Thanks,

Kay
