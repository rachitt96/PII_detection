Message Body :This is the most current information I have on specifications. 

I sent Ben and Mike an email about the 12th slot, but haven't heard from 
either one of them.

By the way, I was asking about whether the changes I had suggested for the 
transformer contract had been included in the Calumet equipment purchase  
terms, as I was confident the changes are in this agreement.
