Kay--I did not get a copy of the interconnection agreement and will ask for

me in the meantime.  Thanks.

Nancy,

Thanks for the wonderful turn around time!

I glanced through the interconnect.  It includes arbitration (poor Dutch)
and equipment outage as force majeure.  Gee, what's good for the goose
should be good for the gander.

Talk to you soon,

Kay
