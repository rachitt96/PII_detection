Message Body :Here's what I can give you without talking to anyone:

I am not familiar with the Goldendale turbine (#7 on ENA long list). ENA's 
CTG group lists #7 as being an EECC turbine for Goldendale, not an ENA asset.

I don't know the 2 used GEC turbines (#8 on ENA long list).  

On the EECC long list, #13 (501D5A) is not slated to be used on an an 
ENA/Electrocities project, as LM's are now being considered (guess you knew 
this).

I believe Blue Dog (#14 on EECC list) has been an EECC deal, not an ENA deal; 
I don't know about the Choc. Bayou or Central Iowa projects listed as ENA 
projects.   Maybe these are sleepers.

I can chase down more info, and Sheila probably has  a great deal she can 
tell you just from looking at the list.

As requested, attached is a listing of the turbine inventory.  Because the 
payment/termination schedules are not consolidated into one file, I will send 
you a hard copy of this information this afternoon.
