Message Body :Just a reminder: the contract gives us 30 days to give them written notice.  
I'm not sure when the clock started ticking - the contract says something 
about the supervisory personnel at the facility becoming aware of the 
problem. (paraphrasing, of course).

Kay -

Looks good.  I'll work to fill in some of the details.

To make matters worse, one of the two units had a compressor blade break off, 
taking the whole unit down (lost 180 Mw).  We might want to hold off until 
Monday when we have a better idea of the total damage and the total time the 
unit will be down.

Mitch,

Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
something out.



Richard, any ideas or comments?

Kay
