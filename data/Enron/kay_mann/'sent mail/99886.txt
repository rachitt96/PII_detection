Subject : Pastoria turbine contract

Message Body :Good  morning,

Enron's finance people are asking about the status of the turbine contract 
for Pastoria.  Since Sheila is on vacation I thought I would check with you.  
Is it in final form, and if so, has it been executed?  It would be a big help 
to get an electronic version sent to me.

Thanks,

Kay
