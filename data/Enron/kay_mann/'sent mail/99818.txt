Message Body :I want to verify that the relationship between VEPCO and NCP is sufficient to 
justify the statement that we are negotiating a Power Purchase Agreement with 
North Carolina.

As for the statement concerning ENA owning the other peaking projects, I 
could verify the correct Enron entities involved given a little time.  
Perhaps we could work around it by saying that "ENA and its affiliates" are 
involved in these other projects.

I'll try to confirm the correct entity to apply.
