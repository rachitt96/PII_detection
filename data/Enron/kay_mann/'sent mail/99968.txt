The SAP people.  I created a folder for SAP and just dumped everything into 
it.  It should  say something like here it is your personal ID number on the 
email.

I'll have to see if I got something.  Hope I didn't think it was trash and 
delete it.  Who sent it?

I need your employee number so I can do your expense report.  You should have 
received an email regarding SAP and your personal employee number.  I have no 
access to that information.  I hope I can find mine when I need it!
