Kay--got it on my list.  We have various forms of interconnection agreements 
to start with and I will also see if VEPCO has one on file at FERC. What's 
happening about the meeting on the 20th--will it take place and if so, 
include lawyers?  Many thanks.

Nancy,

As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants
Enron to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.  Please put
this on your list.  I will check around here to see if there is a form we
want to use as a starting point.

Thanks,

Kay
