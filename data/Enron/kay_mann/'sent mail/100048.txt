Message Body :Hi Carlos,

I'm back in DC, at the Willard, so I'm thinking of you.  We (the commercial 
leads and I) will be in Richmond tomorrow for negotiations, then back 
tomorrow night at the 
Willard.  

I hope things are ok for you. I know it is probably stressful. Hang in there.

Kay
