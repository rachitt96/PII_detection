That will be fine.  I'll reserve a conference room--just let me know when to 
expect you.  Our office is at 2000 K St, N.W., Suite 500.  Do you need any 
help with hotel reservations?

Hi Nancy,

We are still on for Thursday with VEPCO in Richmond.  I would like for you
to participate.  In addition, we would like the opportunity to meet with
you before hand.  We can meet late Wednesday afternoon in DC.  How does
that sound to you?

I look forward to speaking with you soon,

Kay
