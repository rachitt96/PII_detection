Message Body :Hi.

I'm working with Nancy Wodka on a deal with Virginia Power.  We are working 
on the PPA tomorrow.

Thanks for the offer of the tickets.  I'm sure Bob will enjoy the experience, 
even if the game is, well, an Astros game.  What a difference a year makes.

See you soon,

Kay
