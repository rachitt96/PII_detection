I was hoping that you would take the first stab at drafting the 
indemnification language.  In cidentally, I just got off the phone with Karl 
Siverling who seemed surprised that we ahd scheduled a meeting for Monday, 
although he said he is available to come.  He also said that their issues/ 
agenda has been delivered to Brain.  Would you mind checking on this?  Thanks!
