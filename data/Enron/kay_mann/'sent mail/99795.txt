Subject : ABB to do list

Message Body :Here's what I have on the open issues/ to do list:

Resolve shipping/delivery obligations in accordance with option agreement; 
conform contract
Confirm pricing
Add schedule of delivery dates
Finalize assignment language (I sent Mike an email with a question about 
their request)
Agree on effective date: suggest signing date be whatever it is (hope for 
tomorrow) with effective date being the last day of last option
Need estimated price per month to store (a request from Finance for budget 
purposes)
Verify sales tax exemption with WestLB (doesn't require ABB involvement, nor 
does it need to be done before contract is signed)
Need assignment of option (Finance to provide - no ABB action, I'll follow up)

Kathy:  do you have anything to add? Are there any technical details left to 
resolve?

Ben, anything to add?

I'll send a cleaned up version to Mike tomorrow am.

Thanks,

Kay
