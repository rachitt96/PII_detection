Message Body :^I'm not sure I understand it.  I wonder if they mean payment in full has been 
made as of the time of the assignment.

I'm clearing some other stuff off my desk so I can get to this, hopefully 
this afternoon.

Kay:

The last sentence of this clause was not included in my last draft.   After 
being on vacation for four days, I can't remember why I did or didn't do 
what.   Please let me know if you agree that this last sentence should be 
added and if there are any other changes needed.

Thanks.
Kathy

Dear Team,
Dave mentioned that probably the only other change would be in the assignment
section article xxii and that should not be any big change.
