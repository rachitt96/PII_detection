The Commission issued its procedural order, as expected, on August 2.  It
reads just like the draft, except that the Commission did not include the
date for proposed orders that we requested.  We can still make that request
at the evidentiary hearing.

      The public and evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin
Monday, October 2, 2000 at 2:00 pm
      Petitions to intervene are due by September 8;  
      intervenor testimony by September 15; 
      ENA rebuttal by September 27.

CP & L vigorously opposed the interventions in its merger and holding
company documents;  we are going through those filings and roughing out an
opposition to its intervention here should it decide to do so.  I am
checking with the Public Staff on the status of their discovery requests.
