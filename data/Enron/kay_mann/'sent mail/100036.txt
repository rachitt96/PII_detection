Message Body :I wish I could say that's the reason we haven't heard anything. I suspect we 
would have heard if they had a problem with it being WordPerfect.  I hope 
this doesn't mean they haven't tried to open it yet.

I have complained about EECC Contracts using WordPerfect.  As far as I know, 
it is the ONLY Enron group still using it.  EECC Legal uses Word.  I always 
figured this WordPerfect thing was intentional, which is why I had 
WordPerfect loaded on my computer.

I don't think I can make the conversion from home due to download problems.  
I will see that you get a converted copy.
