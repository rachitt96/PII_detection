Message Body :Hmm.  What hotel would be the closest to the Willard? (other than the 
Marriot, which I'm not wild about because it is so big)  What does the Hay 
Adams have?  Alternatively, what do you suggest in Georgetown?

Do you know if anyone else from Enron has stayed there (the Four Seasons) 
recently?

Thanks for asking, by the way.

I don't know the extent of renovations.  Will this be okay?
