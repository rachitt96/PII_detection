Message Body :^Mike,

I've been trying to figure out what is meant by the last sentence. Can you 
(or Dave) clarify what is wanted?  Does it mean that payments must be current 
for the guaranty, etc, to be acceptable?

Thanks,

Kay

Dear Team,
Dave mentioned that probably the only other change would be in the assignment
section article xxii and that should not be any big change.
