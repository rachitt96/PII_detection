Hi Kay,

The menu is as follows:

Hors douerves                 Crab Canapes
Appetizer                          Mocambo Shrimp
Salad                                Smoked Trout on Baby Spring Greens with
fresh                                                             lemon
vinegarette
Sorbet                                Mango
Entree                                Filet Mignon (will be cooked medium
unless
otherwise advised)
                                            Duchess Potatoes
                                            Honey-Glazed Carrots
Dessert                              Almond Apricot Tart
                                            Creme Brulee Coffee


This is what I wrote down when you and I discussed the menu.   We will put a
candle on your father's dessert and I will play "Happy Birthday" while the
family sings.

We are looking forward to having you back again.  If there are any changes,
let me know.
