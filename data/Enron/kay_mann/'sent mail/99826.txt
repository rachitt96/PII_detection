Kay:  I wanted to let you know that I will be out of the office starting 
Friday 7/14 and  returning Monday 7/24.  I have asked Hal Haltom 
(713-220-4109) to fill in during my adsence.  Please give me a call if you 
want to discuss.  Regards, Paul 713-220-4101

As you may know, Word is the "official" program for Enron, so it would be
best to have the document in Word.

Thanks,

Kay
