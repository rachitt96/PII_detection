Message Body :Ed,

To clarify, the Edgecombe we were discussing is in North Carolina.  The New 
York deal is a separate deal.

Thanks,

Kay

Lisa:
One of Kay's developers wants to acquire a land purchase option in Edgecomb 
County, North Carolina ("Edgecomb").  While I recall setting up Edgecomb for 
you, I don't recall whether Edgecomb actually acquired land purchase 
options.    Is this acquisition a coincidence?  Are we resuscitating an 
asphyxiated deal?

Thanks,

Ed

I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.  Do we have a 
company for New York yet?  If not, I seem to recall that we were going to 
start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of 
creating a new one every time.  Am I remembering that correctly?  

Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.  Any 
suggestions?

Thanks,

Kay
