Message Body :Bob,

Here's the bill of sale we didn't use on the last deal.  I don't know how 
much good it will do you, but at least it gives you some tax language.  As I 
mentioned, the last deal was supposed to be a "wire me money, I'll sell you 
stuff" deal, but it didn't  happen.

I'd like to see the installment sale form once it gets fixed up, if possible.

Kay
