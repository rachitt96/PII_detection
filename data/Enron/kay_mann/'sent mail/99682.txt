Brian,
I spoke to Karl today, and we tried to find the "MOU".  All we have found
was the "Assignment & Assumption Letter" you mention.
In that document, the Enron and GE entities were; Enron Capitol & Trade
Resources Corp. and General Electric Company, respectively.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

I have a copy of the "Assignment and Assumption Letter"  where GE agreed
that
Cogen Technologies could assign the rights to purchase the Units to Enron
Capital and Trade Resources, Corp.

The initials at the ECT signature block is Doug Pedigo's.

I have always been a little confused when Karl Siverling talks about voiding
an
MOU, because I do not remember ever seeing an MOU for the Cogen Tech  units.

Perhaps we could ask Karl to send us a copy of the document he intends to
void
to make the process easier.
