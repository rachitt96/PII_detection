Lisa:

Ken Raber (electricities) and I discussed the option agreement yesterday and 
came to the conclusion that any issues electricities has with the option 
agreement will go to you directly.  I believe that will streamline the 
process.

The attorney's name is Mike Colo and his telephone number is 252-972-7105.

I would really like to get this option agreement signed as soon as we can and 
I'm sure you feel the same!

If there is anything I can do let me know.

Jeffrey
