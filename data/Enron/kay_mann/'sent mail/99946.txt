Kay--this is not a good evening for computers.  When I tried to print the 
option agreement, it came through as gibberish.  Could you try sending the 
doc again?  Thanks.

Gentlemen,

Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land
option agreement.  The most significant change is that it is clear that the
option payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the
purchase price.  There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re
assignment) that the assignee remains responsible for any liability arising
prior to assignment.

I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.  Please
advise if this version is acceptable.  Also, please let me know if you
would like for me to have a redline version prepared.

Kay
