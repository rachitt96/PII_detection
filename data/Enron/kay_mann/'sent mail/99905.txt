Message Body :Hi.

I don't think I would have Rob participate in the call.    Just doesn't feel 
right.

I haven't heard any feedback from this morning's conference call.  Have you?  

Kay

I have sent it to Rob - I can get you something back for the call - for 
instance, the assignment language and the "relationship of the parties" kind 
of stuff.  


Is that what you mean?  Rob was not planning to be on the call, but I may be 
able to twist his arm - plus, my meeting will probably take only 1/2 hour, so 
I could perhaps join you.
