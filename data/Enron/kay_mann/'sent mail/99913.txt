Message Body :Hi Nancy,

I've misplaced your direct line - could you email it to me?

The travel schedules of the Enron delegation are becoming complicated.  Would 
it be possible for you to travel with us to Richmond tomorrow night?  That 
would give us more flexibility in case we need to convene before the meeting 
on Thursday.  We are staying at the Marriott in Richmond.

Thanks,

Kay
