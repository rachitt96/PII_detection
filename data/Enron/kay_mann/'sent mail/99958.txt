Message Body :I sent it to Ken and Mike.  They had difficulty opening it, but did get it 
open this am.  I haven't heard back since then.

Herman wants to meet on Thursday or Friday to discuss structure.  What do you 
think?

The Willard was booked, so I'm staying at the Monarch, near Nancy's office.  
I'm taking flight that gets to DC around 1100.  

We received an email from Allyson that indicates that we may be able to get 
some deadlines set so that the CPCN is issued by November 1.  She says it is 
muy mal to begin construction before it is issued.

Do you want to have a conference call this afternoon with Nancy to discuss 
the draft PPA?

Kay,

Where do we stand with this?  Did you send an updated
version to Ken?  Let me know because I'd like to call
him and get him moving on this.
