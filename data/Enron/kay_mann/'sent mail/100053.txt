Message Body :Hi Gregg,

I'm back.  I don't know what the deal was with my cell phone this week.  
Perhaps the problem was the weak signal in the area.  Several people 
commented that they had problems reaching me, and my phone was on almost the 
entire time. In fact, I  made many calls, but I ususally checked to see if I 
had a signal first.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

I'll take a look at the DASH, etc, and get up to speed so that I can speak 
intelligently.

Kay
