This is the hotel where you will stay in DC.  It was formerly the A&A or 
something like that, but it's been renovated and looks very nice.  The 
tickets are complete and on the way to be ticketed.  Got the Jefferson with 
no problem.  I haven't seen the flights but I'm sure they are fine.  I will 
defintely check them out.
