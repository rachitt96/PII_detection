Subject : Coral letter agreement

Message Body :I forgot to mention something yesterday.  3 (g) states that within 10 days of 
closing we will provide Coral with the documents on Exhibit T.  I personally 
do not know if we have all the documents listed. We need to either verify 
that we have these documents, or add some language about providing the ones 
in our possession.

Thanks,

Kay
