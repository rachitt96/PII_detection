Off-peak includes all weekends and NERC defined holidays.  For example, 
Friday at hour ending 2300 until hour ending 0600 Monday, you are off-peak.  
Let me know if you need those holidays, the control room guys can dig them 
up.

According to the control room guys, "off peak" is defined as hour ending 2300 
to hour ending 0600.  They indicate that this is a NERC standard.
