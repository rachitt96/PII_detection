Message Body :Kay,  I think they will have the following questions:


3.  Liquidated Damages - does this still allow "unit contingent" power 
deals?  That is all we will be buying from them.
5.  Events of Default and Remedies - Is this OK with Mississippi law??
6.  Billing and Payment Netting - I don't think the terms will work.  Their 
boards meets the second and fourth Tuesday of each month.  Payment cannot be 
authorized until the board approves.
10.  Miscellaneous - the arbitration language is the Houston venue....


I just got your email, so I will send it anyway.
