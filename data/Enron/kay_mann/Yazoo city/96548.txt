Message Body :OK, I see your point.  Incremental may be misleading. How about this??

&Market Price8 is the price agreed to in any transaction inclusive of all 
costs specific to the same transaction.



 Incremental to me means an increased cost.  I'm not sure what the cost is 
"incremental" of.  I'm just trying to figure out if "incremental" is 
descriptive, or just an extra word the engineers (sorry) threw in.

Incremental costs, for example, would be transmission and losses associated 
with a sale of power if that sale specified a delivery point away from the 
MDEA interconnect with Entergy.  For example, EPMI sells 22 MW from the 
Clarksdale unit for $40/MWh to Southern at the Southern border.  The 
transaction includes $4 of transmission and $0.50 of losses.  Therefore, the 
Market Price is $44.50.

Thanks

What is an incremental cost?  I'm not sure I get it.

Kay-

Discussions with RW Beck have resulted in the following changes:

From the EMSA:
&Market Price8 is the price agreed to in any transaction inclusive of 
incremental costs specific to the same transaction.

From the Profit Calculation Exhibit:
"Profit per hour is calculated as the product of MWh sold and the difference 
between Market Price and the Target Production Cost as follows:...."  (delete 
the reference limiting Profit to Back-to-back Transactions)
