Brett,

Just a few comments.  Exhibit H-2 Training and Exhibit B-2 Specifications 
need to be added.  Exhibit N-1 does not have the unit price.  The Contract 
Terms do not have the contract price.

I failed to forward this to you guys yesterday.  Please work to come up with 
consolidated comments as soon as possible.  Same comment on major problems as 
opposed to small comments.

Thanks,
Brett

The first of these two documents contains the key terms of the GE contract 
for the ESA deal.  It was prepared by GE.  Your comments would be appreciated.

Here's what I think we should have on the ESA exhibits.  Let's see if it
will hunt.

Thanks,
