Brett,

Just a few comments.  Exhibit H-2 Training and Exhibit B-2
Specifications
need to be added.  Exhibit N-1 does not have the unit price.  The
Contract
Terms do not have the contract price.

John

I failed to forward this to you guys yesterday.  Please work to come up
with consolidated comments as soon as possible.  Same comment on major
problems as opposed to small comments.

Thanks,
Brett

The first of these two documents contains the key terms of the GE
contract
for the ESA deal.  It was prepared by GE.  Your comments would be
appreciated.

Here's what I think we should have on the ESA exhibits.  Let's see if it
will hunt.

Thanks,
