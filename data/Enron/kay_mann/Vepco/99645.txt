Subject : Aug 15 draft of CEC

Message Body :I am attaching a redline of a revised version of the document formerly known 
as the PPA.  This is compared against the August 7 draft.  

I am sending it without anyone else reading it (a gutsy and foolhardy move), 
so it is subject to further Enron review.

Thanks,

Kay
