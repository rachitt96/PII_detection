Hope to see you at my birthday party...It's not for quite some time, but this 
is a darn good way to procrastinate on my paper. My mom hasn't for sure 
secured it with Kenneally's, but it should be there...I'll let you know if it 
moves and give you directions and such in the summer. I just want to get an 
idea of who is even available. It's a Thursday night, but heck that's close 
enough to Friday. Some people can definitely stay at my house. Oh, and for 
your SU people, it's the last day of Mayterm, so you won't have class the 
next day anyway. Have a great weekend, and let me know if you might be able 
to make it.
