The attached ST Firm and Non-firm point to point transmission agreements are 
"blankets" that do not commit Clarksdale to any costs or transmission until 
they reserve transmission on OASIS.  However, once Clarksdale signs up for 
network, it will be obligated to pay (more like a demand charge each month).

1.a)  "EPMI will use this Network service .... and will arrange for any other 
transmission service...

Who will pay for such transmission?  Just want to make clear in the doc.
