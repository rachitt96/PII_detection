Message Body :Attached is a spread sheet that can be used to calculate our exposure for the 
month of MAY.

Notes:

I do not have Yazoo's load so I used 80% of Clarksdale as a proxy.

I created a energy model that used a 10.5 heat rate and $5.20 gas.

The SEPA energy was not included and no cost for startups.

Looks like worst case we would be exposed for roughly One Million for May.

I can refine the model more if required.
