We would like to use Tripp Scott as a lobbyist for our Pompano plant. As he 
will not be providing us legal counsel, can we use his proposed form of 
engagment letter? Anything you can do on this would be appreciated. I'll 
forward you the e-mail with Tripp's form attached.

Thanks,

Ben

Enron received a 2 page engagement letter from Tripp Scott a few weeks ago - 
I will re-send to you.  Roger's proposed engagement letter has 9 pages.  

Is it Enron's policy to use our standard form?

I have started the process for internal approval to engage you and your firm 
relating to Enron's power development project.  To speed up the process I am 
attached a blank form of our engagement letter that we will modify to 
correspond to your specific work and fee agreement.  Even though items such 
as the fee section will have to be modified I thought it would be helpful for 
you to review some of the standard terms included in engagement letters with 
attorneys.
Roger
