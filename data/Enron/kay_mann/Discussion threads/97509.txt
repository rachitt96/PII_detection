Message Body :Kay, Hancock has delivered a revised letter that eliminates the language 
related to "committee approvals".  At some point today, can you provide me 
with a short matrix outlining the status of and the remaining risk related to 
completing the items in paragraph two of Hancock's letter and other such CPs 
in the Salmon Letter Agreement?  Once we have that, we should debrief Chris 
and Louise as to our view on Delta's ability to close on the purchase.
