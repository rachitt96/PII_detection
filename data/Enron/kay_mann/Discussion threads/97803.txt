Subject : ENA/NorthWestern: Certificate of Amendment & Closing Checklist

Message Body :Marguerite:

Because NorthWestern would like to change the name of Merchant Energy
Ventures, LLC to Montana Megawatts I, LLC at Closing, I have prepared a
Certificate of Amendment to this effect.  A copy of the Certificate of
Amendment is attached.  Also attached is a Closing Checklist that attempts
to capture the status of the transaction.  Please let me know if you have
any comments to either the Certificate or the Checklist.  Thanks.

Regards,

Marisa
