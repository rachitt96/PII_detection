Message Body :The performance testing guidelines we used on the TECO and Linden #6

liquid fuel.

Chris, Tony, Jeff:

Here is the first, cut.  You can see that the Attachments need information.
I will insert the GEI liquid fuel specification since it is a PDF file.
Chris, Jeff gave you till Friday to provide the liquid fuel composition
without impact to production.  Please provide soonest.

Tony: I already sent you the contract so you can see what Basis Conditions
need to be added and what testing guidelines too.

Jeff:  What do you see is missing?
