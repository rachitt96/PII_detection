Message Body :Attached are my comments on the Midway LOI.

FYI, Duran and I spoke to Mike Carlson of TECO regarding Ft. Pierce. Dave 
really wants us to push to get something done on that project. It would be 
similarly styled to our Midway - TECO discussions (ENA sells the dev, asset 
and takes back a 5 year toll). 

Mike Carlson said he would get his lawyer to generate a LOI on Ft.Pierce, but 
I think we need to get them comments back on Midway to expedite this.

Kay - have you had any luck engaging King & Spaulding on these deals?

Let's talk about these comments at your earliest convenience.

Fred - we need the term sheet on the toll, and the toll price refreshed by 
the desk, as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Ben
