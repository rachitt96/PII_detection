Subject: FW: New Exhibit C


Here is the latest version of exhibit C, the fixed spec, which now includes
the correction factor discussion.  I assumed that this was sent with the
contract draft that Jackie sent to Kay later that day, but it apparently
wasn't.  Note that the message refers to a new draft of the test protocol,
which is the one I sent out on 11/22/00.
