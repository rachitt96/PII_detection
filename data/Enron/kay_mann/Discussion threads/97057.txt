Message Body :I did not think the One-Train Contract had been signed.  If it has, we
should include it.  As I do not have a copy of either contract, I do not
know the answer to your question on GE's ability to ask for assurances
of performance.  I should be getting a copy today of the Two-Train
Contract and I will check.  I inserted the provision regarding Agent's
giving notice to GE of DevCo's default at Rose's request.

Rob, why isn't the Pastoria One-Train contract included (it has now been
signed I believe)?  If Agent were to give GE notice of Devco's default,
does GE have a rememdy under the turbine contracts to ask for collateral
or
accelerate the payment schedule?  I know that GE did not mention this in
our call.  What will Devco be able to do, just in case GE asks about
this?
Otherwise the draft l;ooks good and we await GE's comments.  The guay at
GE
to send this to by the way is Paul Miller@ps.ge.com.  Thanks!
