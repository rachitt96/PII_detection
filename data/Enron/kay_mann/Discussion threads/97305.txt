Subject : Larry Bishops form of Reimburseable contract for Eletrobolt

Message Body :Kay,

Attached is a form of a reimburseble contract that can be used for the Coop 
City project.   I have not read the agreement, but think it is a good 
starting point.  I understand you will try to conform it with David Lund's 
term sheet.  After you have done so, please distribute it back to us for 
review  before you send it to the client, per our phone conversation.  You 
will appreicate that I 'm still reserving my comments on the contract since I 
have yet to actually read it.
