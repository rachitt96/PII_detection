Subject : Non-Compete Provision Binding Affiliates

Message Body :Jeff, I am working on the divestiture of a project company that had been 
developing a power plant site in Illinois and as part of our proposed 
purchase and sale agreement, the purchaser has requested a non-compete 
obligation of 2.5 years with respect to the project and project company that 
we are selling that would bind both ENA and its Affiliates.  I recall that 
previously there was a policy which required certain approvals (including 
Mark Metts of Corporate Development) for non-compete agreements that were 
binding on other entities beyond the immediate business unit involved in the 
transaction.  Could you help us out and let us know whom we need to contact.  
Thanks. 

PS  I am working on a legal risk memo for this transaction and will forward 
it to you a draft later today or early tomorrow as we are hoping to DASH and 
close on it by the end of this week.
