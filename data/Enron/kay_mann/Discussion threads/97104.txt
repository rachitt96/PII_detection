Message Body :From the below, it does appear that for the PSCo project they want to make a 
change order to the ABB transformers.  I have a call into Ben Jacoby to 
discuss paying in full vs obtaining consents.

Subject: Change order to the ABB transformer contract

Per our phone conversation, here is the latest copy I've seen of Change Order 
#1 to the ABB transformer contract.  Your document should be drafted as 
Change Order #2 and any additional costs should be added to the contract 
total of $7,503,600.00, as amended by Change Order #1.  I'm assuming you'll 
have one of the attorneys on the Fountain Valley project (Al Larsen?) look 
over the language and confirm that the first change order has been executed.
