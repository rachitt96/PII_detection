Greg and Isabel:

Enclosed are clean and blacklined copies of the final draft of the First
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement.  The blackline
reflects changes from the 4-04-01 draft which was attached as Exhibit A to
the letter agreement.  The only outstanding matter is to fill in three blank
dates on pages 1, 2 and A-3.  Please review and advise of any comments.
Thanks.
