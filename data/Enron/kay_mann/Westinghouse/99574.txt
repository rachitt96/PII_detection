Gentlemen,

I've revised paragraph 5 to reflect our discussion.  Also, I made a change
to paragraph 7 to include technical bulletins per Mitch's request which we
did not discuss on our call.

(See attached file: WestinghouseProposal to Resolve Issues on Enron - Dec10
SWPC.doc)

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
