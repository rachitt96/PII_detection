Message Body :They are aware that the Broward County Tax Appraiser will assess the property 
and that as most industrial facilities, the equipment is subject to 
depreciation.; The City's millage rate has remained fairly constant (stagnant 
growth), but;as the tax base increases, they expect the millage rate to 
decrease.; The City is looking for a fixed annual revenue stream of $1.5 - 
1.726 mm (similar to Pompano's 1.5 mm).
;
After we have all had a chance to review the doc - it would be good to have a 
conference call to discuss.; We're targetting to get a draft to the City 
early next week.
;

Ad valorems do not necessarily decrease as a result of depreciation, because 
millage rates and a current years reassessment also are part of the 
calculation. 

Have they asked for this?

 We wanted to maintain a recurring 1.5mm and since ad advalorems will 
decrease as a function of depreciation we thought the way to maintain the 
constant we to increase the 650k at the same rate as the depreciation.
