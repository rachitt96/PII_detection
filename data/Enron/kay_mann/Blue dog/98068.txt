Message Body :How about "The Deal Might Not Happen LLC". In a call yesterday, Northwestern 
proposed changing the economic terms significantly, which would reduce our 
gross margin by more than half. We are awaiting a written proposal.

It probably makes sense to go ahead anyway with the formation of the LLC, 
because we'll eventually need it even if this particular deal does not close. 
How about Merchant Energy Ventures, L.L.C. ?

Let's catch up tomorrow.

Regards,

Ben

We need a name for the LLC for this transaction.  Any suggestions?
