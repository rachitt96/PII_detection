Subject: Northwestern Offer Letter

Chris, prior to our call this afternoon, I wanted to alert you to one term
that was discussed in our Monday telephone call that I inadvertently left
out of the letter you received yesterday.  Specifically, we would want the
Enron carry to continue until September 1, 2001.  Thus, Northwestern would
be obligated to close on the transaction (and get Enron its money) on or
before this date.  Again, this specific term was discussed in the Monday
call and left out of the letter.  I apologize for the oversight.  Let me
know if this is a problem.
