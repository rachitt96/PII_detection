Chris,

I am the account manager for the Enron relationship.  I understand you would
like to establish an escrow in pretty short order.

Attached are Citibank's comments to the escrow agreement.  In order to
complete this transaction, Escrow also needs to receive the following
documents:

1) completed incumbency by all parties to the agmt;
2) Form W-9 for NorthWestern only; and
3) signed fee schedule.

Once I receive an execution copy of the agreement, I will provide you with
Citibank's wire instructions.  You have the option of including our fees
with the initial deposit or wiring our fees directly to our billing
department.  Please let me know which you prefer so that I may coordinate on
our end.

I look forward to working with you and trust that you will feel free to
contact me should you have any questions or comments.
