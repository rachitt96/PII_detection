Re:  Acquisition of General Electric 7EA Turbines\par 
\par 
Ladies and Gentlemen:\par 
\par 
\pard\s15\frmtxlrtb Pursuant to our discussions last week, the following summarizes the main commercial terms agreed to by NorthWestern Corporation (\ldblquote NorthWestern\rdblquote ) and Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") (individually NorthWestern and ENA are hereinafter referred to as a \ldblquote Party\rdblquote  and collectively they are referred to as the \ldblquote Parties\rdblquote ) regarding NorthWestern\rquote s purchase through the LLC referred to below or as otherwise accomplished without violation of the Turbine Contract referred to below (the \ldblquote Purchase\rdblquote ) of two (2) General Electric (\ldblquote GE\rdblquote ) 7EA combustion turbines (the \ldblquote Turbines\rdblquote ), the first of which is presently located at a GE storage facility, and the second of which is scheduled to be available for delivery in February, 2002, and both of which are subject to purchase from GE under an agreement with GE dated as of May 31, 2000 (the \ldblquote Turbine Contract\rdblquote ) with respect to which ENA has the right to cause a limited liability company in which, prior to commercial operation of the Turbines, ENA holds a 20% equity interest and a wholly-owned NorthWestern subsidiary (the \ldblquote NorthWestern Subsidiary\rdblquote ) holds an 80% equity interest (the \ldblquote LLC\rdblquote ) to become the purchaser:\par 
\pard\frmtxlrtb\par 
1.  \plain\f2\fs20\ul Purchase Price\plain\f2\fs20 :  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbines (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5 below).\par 
\par 
2.  \plain\f2\fs20\ul Closing Date of Purchase\plain\f2\fs20 :  The Purchase will close on a date on or prior to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days\rquote  written notice to ENA (provided that such notice may not be given less than 30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement providing for and relating to the Purchase).\par 
\par 
3.  \plain\f2\fs20\ul Cash Down Payment\plain\f2\fs20 :  NorthWestern will pay ENA an $8.0 million down payment for the Turbines.  The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0 million down payment will be due upon the signing of the Definitive Agreement (as defined below).  The second installment ($5.0 million) of the $8.0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of (i) closing of the Purchase, or (ii) July 15, 2001.\par 
\par 
4. \plain\f2\fs20\ul  Liquidated Damages\plain\f2\fs20 :   If, prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contract, the purchaser under the Turbine Contract receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract, then ENA will give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible.  Any liquidated damages accrued under the Turbine Contract prior to the closing of the Purchase will be for the sole benefit of ENA (and may be used or applied by ENA as it shall determine in its sole discretion) and shall not affect the purchase price payable by NorthWestern to ENA for the {\strike Purchase} {\b\uldb Turbines}.    \par 
\par 
5. \plain\f2\fs20\ul  Carry Period\plain\f2\fs20 :  ENA will provide an interest-free carry on the unpaid purchase price of the Turbines until July 15, 2001. If the closing of the Purchase occurs after July 15, 2001, then the unpaid purchase price of the Turbines will be increased by interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the unpaid purchase price of the Turbines ($40.0 million) for each day from, and including, July 15, 2001 to, but excluding, the closing date.\par 
\par 
\softpage 6. \plain\f2\fs20\ul  Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2\plain\f2\fs20 :  ENA will not proceed with this change order to effect the conversion.  Instead, it will be the responsibility of NorthWestern to effect the change order with GE after the closing date.  \par 
\par 
7.  \plain\f2\fs20\ul Unpaid Price of Second Turbine\plain\f2\fs20 :  At the time of closing, one or more installments of the purchase price of the second Turbine will be payable to GE under the Turbine Contract (the \ldblquote Unpaid Installments\rdblquote ).  ENA will be obligated to pay the Unpaid Installments to GE as they become due under the Turbine Contract. \par 
\par 
8.  \plain\f2\fs20\ul Guarantees:\plain\f2\fs20    There will be no guarantee by Enron Corp. of any of the representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities or other obligations of ENA in connection with the Purchase.  All obligations of the LLC under the Turbine Contract, as well as all obligations of the NorthWestern Subsidiary to ENA in connection with the transaction, will be guaranteed by NorthWestern Corporation.\par 
\par 
NorthWestern and ENA have acknowledged that the above commercial terms have received all necessary NorthWestern and ENA internal approvals.  Notwithstanding such approvals, the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Turbines remains subject to the review and approval of the structure for the Purchase by both of the Parties and the negotiation of final documentation relating to the Purchase (the \ldblquote Definitive Agreement\rdblquote ).  In light of this acknowledgement, NorthWestern and ENA agree  to negotiate{\strike , in good faith } {\b\uldb expeditiously and in good faith during the Term (as defined below) the Definitive Agreement relating to the Purchase.  In this regard, NorthWestern and ENA agree that such negotiation shall be} with reference to{\strike ,} and on the basis of{\strike , the documents} {\b\uldb the draft documentation} previously {\strike furnished} {\b\uldb forwarded} by ENA to NorthWestern{\strike (though subject to further discussion on}{\b\uldb ; provided that such documentation remains subject to (i) incorporation of the commercial terms described in Sections 1 through 8 above, (ii) further discussion concerning} the structure of the {\strike transaction; provided that }{\b\uldb Purchase and (iii) further comments of NorthWestern; and provided further that ENA\rquote s agreement to} any change proposed by NorthWestern {\strike must be tax and accounting neutral to ENA), the Definitive Agreement relating to the Purchase as promptly as practicable} {\b\uldb shall be in ENA\rquote s sole discretion}.  For the avoidance of any doubt, it is expressly stated, acknowledged and agreed that \plain\f2\fs20\cf1 neither Party shall have any obligation whatsoever to purchase or sell the Turbines, or any interest in the LLC holding rights to such Turbines, except pursuant to the terms of the Definitive Agreement executed by both Parties.  It is further understood and agreed that the Definitive Agreement must be mutually acceptable to both Parties and neither Party shall have any obligation whatsoever to enter into the Definitive Agreement on any terms other than those commercial terms in Sections 1 through 8 above and such other terms as are acceptable to such Party in its sole discretion.\plain\f2\par 
\par 
\plain\f2\fs20 ENA grants to NorthWestern, and NorthWestern grants to ENA, an exclusive \ldblquote no shop\rdblquote  period through the close of business on Monday, April 16, 2001 (the \ldblquote Term\rdblquote ).  \plain\f2\fs20\cf1 Northwestern acknowledges that prior to the date hereof ENA has shared information about the Turbines with other prospective purchasers (the \ldblquote Prior Prospective Purchasers\rdblquote ) and that ENA has initiated the solicitation and negotiation of offers from such Prior Prospective Purchasers in connection therewith.  ENA agrees that, during the Term, ENA (a) shall not share any information relative to the Turbines with any prospective purchasers of the Turbines {\strike other than NorthWestern (}{\b\uldb ,} including the Prior Prospective Purchasers{\strike ,} {\b\uldb other than NorthWestern (}the \ldblquote Prospective Purchasers\rdblquote ); (b) shall abstain from further solicitation of or negotiation with any Prospective Purchasers concerning the purchase of the Turbines; and (c) shall not accept any offers to purchase the Turbines from any Prospective Purchaser.  Northwestern agrees that, during the Term, NorthWestern will not discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, with any person or entity other than ENA for or in respect of the purchase or other acquisition by NorthWestern of turbines from such person or entity.\plain\f3\cf1   \par 
\plain\f2\fs20\par

The No Shop Payment will not be subject to refund to NorthWestern by ENA for any reason or upon any circumstance (including, without limitation, failure of NorthWestern and ENA \softpage to agree upon the structure of the Purchase, or to enter into the Definitive Agreement), nor will it be applied to the {\strike Purchase Price} {\b\uldb purchase price payable by NorthWestern for the Turbines}.  \par 
\par
