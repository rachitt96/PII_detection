\pard\s2\qj\fi-360\li360\sa240\tx360\tx1800\frmtxlrtb (a)\tab The Parties shall not be deemed in a relationship of partners or joint venturers by virtue of this Agreement or in a principal/agent relationship.  EPMI shall serve as an independent contractor in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and does not undertake by this Agreement or otherwise to perform any regulatory or contractual obligation of MDEA, or to assume any liability for MDEA's business or operations.  Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, neither of the Parties shall have any separate obligations or duties, including without limitation any fiduciary duties, other implied duties or obligations to perform.  While EPMI intends to assist MDEA in optimizing the value of the Facilities by seeking to maximize Net Revenues, EPMI shall not be under any obligation to provide MDEA with the best prices or opportunities on any of the products to be sold or purchased hereunder, including, without limitation, Energy, Available Energy, Ancillary Services, Capacity and fuel.  MDEA hereby agrees that it is sophisticated, capable of assessing the risks and merits of the Transactions to be entered into pursuant to this Agreement and retains sole responsibility for deciding the types and terms of the Transactions to be consummated and whether to enter into and maintain the relationship formed by this Agreement and for securing the information necessary for it to make all decisions in relation hereto.  To the extent that EPMI (or its affiliates) offers advice or recommendations in connection with the Transactions, MDEA agrees that it shall not (i) rely exclusively on such advice in making its decisions or (ii) seek to hold EPMI liable as a result thereof.  EPMI shall not be responsible for any business opportunities that may not be realized by MDEA. \par

EPMI is in the business of (i) buying and selling Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services throughout the United States and (ii) providing Scheduling Services for itself and for third parties (some of whom may be competitors to MDEA) and fully expects to continue to enter into such transactions and perform such services during the Term of this Agreement.  EPMI shall not be under any obligation to disclose such activities to MDEA or to offer MDEA any interest in such activities.  Neither this Agreement nor any activity undertaken pursuant hereto shall prevent EPMI from engaging in such activities, require EPMI to disclose the same or otherwise create any liability on the part of EPMI under this Agreement, and as a material part of the consideration for the execution of this Agreement, MDEA hereby waives, relinquishes and renounces any such right or claim of notice or participation in such activities.  \par

Neither this Agreement nor any activity undertaken pursuant hereto shall prevent EPMI from engaging in such activities, require EPMI to disclose the same or otherwise create any liability on the part of EPMI under this Agreement, and as a material part of the consideration for the execution of this Agreement, MDEA hereby waives, relinquishes and renounces any such right or claim of notice or participation in such activities.  \par
