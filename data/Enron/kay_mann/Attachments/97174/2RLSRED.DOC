So long as the Indemnitor, at Indemnitor's cost and expense, (1) has undertaken the defense of, and assumed full responsibility for all Covered Liabilities with respect to, such claim, (2) is reasonably contesting such claim in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and (3) has taken such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit, or other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Party for payment of such claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim.  Notwithstanding compliance by the Indemnitor with the preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim, provided that, if the Indemnitor is in compliance with the preceding sentence at the time of such payment or settlement by the Indemnified Party then in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnitor for such claim.  If, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder, the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party that it elects, at Indemnitor's cost and expense, to undertake the defense thereof and assume full responsibility for all Covered Liabilities with respect thereto, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest such claim in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the Indemnified Party's property as contemplated above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle, or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.\par
