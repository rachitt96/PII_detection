Each Party agrees to discuss in good faith any dispute, controversy or claim arising under this Agreement (a \ldblquote \plain\fs22\ul Claim\plain\fs22\rdblquote ).  If the Claim has not been resolved by discussion, and if either Party so requests, the Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve the Claim by mediation in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Commercial Mediation Rules (the \ldblquote \plain\fs22\ul Rules\plain\fs22\rdblquote ).  One mediator shall be chosen by the parties.  If the Parties are not able to agree upon a mediator within ten (10) days after either Party proposes a mediator, the sole mediator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the Rules.  The Claim that is the subject of the mediation shall be resolved in accordance with and on the basis of the substantive laws (not including the conflicts of laws rules) of the State of Texas.  The place of mediation shall be Houston, Texas.  Each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs incurred by it, but the cost of mediation, to be specified in accordance with the Rules, shall be allocated by the mediator. The mediator shall not have authority to apportion (equally or otherwise) the legal or other costs, including attorneys fees, incurred by the Parties themselves.  If the mediation is successfully concluded, the Parties shall enter into a settlement agreement setting forth the terms thereof and the settlement of the Claim.  Such settlement agreement shall be final and binding on the Parties, each of which agrees to waive any right of appeal thereon.  Judgment may be entered in relation to the settlement agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction.\par
