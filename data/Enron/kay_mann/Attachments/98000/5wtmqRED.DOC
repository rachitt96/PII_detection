 Indemnified Party (herein referred to as an "Indemnified Party"), and if such party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this Section 13, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify }{\strike\fs22\cf1 TEH}{\fs22\cf1  }{\b\fs22\uldb\cf1 
SEL}{\fs22\cf1  or ENA, as the case may be (herein referred to as the "Indemnitor"), of such claims.  The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to undertake, conduct, and control, through counsel of its own
 choosing and at its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; provided that the Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense th
r
ough counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party at the expenses of such Indemnified Party.  So long as the Indemnitor, at Indemnitor's cost and expense, (1) has undertaken the defense of, and assumed full responsibility for all Covered Liabilities with resp

 indemnity therefor by the Indemnitor for such claim.  If, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder, the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party that it elects, at Indemnitor's 
c
ost and expense, to undertake the defense thereof and assume full responsibility for all Covered Liabilities with respect thereto, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest such claim in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien again
st or attachment of the Indemnified Party's property as contemplated above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle, or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.
