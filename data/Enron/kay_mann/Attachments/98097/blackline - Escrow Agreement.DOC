may sell, convey or otherwise dispose of any Escrow Property for such purpose.  The Escrow Agent may in its sole discretion withhold from any distribution of Escrow Property an amount of Escrow Property it believes would, upon sale or liquidation, produce
 proceeds equal to any unpaid amounts to which Escrow Agent is entitled to hereunder.  
\par (c)\tab As security for the due and punctual performance of any and all of Depositor\rquote s, or Depositors\rquote , as the case may be, obligations to Escrow Agent hereunder, now or her

Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, Escrow Agent shall proceed as soon as practicable to collect any checks or other collection items at any time deposited here
under.  Should Escrow Agent in its sole discretion or otherwise credit Distributions before the same are finally collected, such credits shall be provisional and may be reversed by Escrow Agent without notice until such time as the same shall be finally c
ollected.  All such collections shall be subject to Escrow Agent\rquote

\par 9.\tab The Escrow Agent shall not be 
under any duty to give the Escrow Property held by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar property and shall not be required to invest any funds held hereunder except as provided in this Escrow Agreement.  Uninvested funds h
eld hereunder shall not earn or accrue interest.
\par 10.\tab When the Escrow Agent is instructed in writing to deliver securities against payment, or to effect payment against delivery, delivery and receipt of payment may not be completed simultaneously, and each D

 provision herein (or to such other address as may be substituted therefor by written not

u
ctions or other communications believed by it to have been sent or given by Depositors or by a person or persons authorized by Depositors.  Whenever under the terms hereof the time for giving a notice or performing an act falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or
 a banking holiday in New York, such time shall be extended to the next day on which the Escrow Agent is open for business.
\par 13.\tab Depositors, jointly and severally, shall be liable for and shall reimburse and indemnify Escrow Agent (and any predecessor Escrow
 Agent) and hold Escrow Agent harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\rquote  fees and expenses) (collectively \ldblquote Losses\rdblquote 
) arising from or in connection with its administ
ration of this Agreement, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall require Escrow Agent to be indemnified for Losses caused by its own gross negligence or own willful misconduct for which Escrow Agent has assumed liability pursuant to preced
i
ng subparagraph (a) of paragraph 5 of Part I hereof.  In addition, when the Escrow Agent acts on any information, instructions or communications (including, but not limited to, communications with respect to the delivery of securities or the wire transfer
 
of funds) sent by telephone, telex or facsimile, the Escrow Agent, absent gross negligence, shall not be responsible or liable in the event such communication is not an authorized or authentic communication of the Depositor(s) or is not in the form the De
