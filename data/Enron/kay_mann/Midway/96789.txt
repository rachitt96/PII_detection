Message Body : 
 Attached is my work on the Midway tolling draft.

 The PRC reviews have kept me from completing more to date.  I will take it 
with me to Arizona today and work on it from the plane.

 I will try to fax you each my additions on Tuesday, as I will be back in the 
office on Wednesday. 

 I will have my cell on this afternoon and Tuesday while travelling, but I 
doubt I can get service while in the Grand Canyon Saturday through Monday.

 Have a great holiday weekend!


 Fred
