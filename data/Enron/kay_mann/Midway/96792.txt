Subject : TECO Term Sheet

Message Body :Attached is the draft term sheet for the Midway toll.  I have pulled in the 
language from the earlier draft and incorporated Black Hills language where 
applicable. I have left the pricing blank for now, subject to a refresh from 
structuring.

Let's discuss sometime tomorrow.
