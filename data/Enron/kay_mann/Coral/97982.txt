Subject : Tejas/ENA

Message Body :Attached is a revised version of ENA's last redline of the letter
agreement re the transformer.  Coral has not yet reviewed these changes.
 I also suggest that the following be added to the end of Section 6.1 of
the LLC Agreement:

"For avoidance of any doubt, no Transfer by ENA shall operate to
release ENA from its obligations under Section 6.2."

I have not yet received any comments from Coral on the LLC Agreement
redraft.

I will give you specific comments Sat. morning on the acknowledgement
letter from ABB.
