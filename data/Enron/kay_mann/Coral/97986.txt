Subject : Re: ABB Transformers - Coral Acknowledgement Letter

Message Body :Mike:

After you review the Coral Acknowledgement Letter I sent earlier, it would be 
really helpful if you would write me a letter on your letterhead saying that 
your prepared to sign the letter when you sign the Facility Agreement. 
Attached is some suggested language.

Thanks much,

Ben
