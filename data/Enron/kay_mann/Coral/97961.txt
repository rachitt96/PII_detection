Message Body :As soon as I hit the "send" button I recalled another issue.  Enron does not 
want the LLC used for anything other than the 
acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.  Other development 
activities should be conducted in another entity, at least so long as Enron 
has an ownership interest.  I'm going to double check this, as it seems the 
LOI is fairly specific on this point.
