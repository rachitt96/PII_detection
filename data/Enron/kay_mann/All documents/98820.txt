Attached is a draft of an agreement between Enron Corp. and the Enron entity 
that is the managing member of enovate under which Enron Corp.'s treasury 
department would agree to provide certain funds management services on behalf 
of the managing member.  Gregg, as we discussed with the People's attorney, 
this agreement would establish the link between enovate's managing member and 
Enron Corp. with respect to these services, since the managing member has the 
authority to take these actions, but Enron Corp. would be the entity actually 
doing the work.  We should resist any attempt to make enovate or any other 
party a party to this Agreement, since we want only the Enron entity that is 
the managing member to have a cause of action against Enron Corp. for any 
breach of this agreement, etc.

Kay, I am out of the office, and I didn't bring the enovate LLC agreement 
with me.  Could you fill in the blanks for me in this document with the 
correct names, jurisdictions of organization, etc.?  

Gregg, if you could take a look at the description of services to make sure 
that it captures everything that the treasury group does for enovate, that 
would be great.
