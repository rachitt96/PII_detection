As discussed, Roger has no problem engaging Tripp Scott.  He does want to use 
Enron's standard 9 page engagement letter in lieu of the attached 2 pager 
received from Tripp Scott.  Is this necessary - any thoughts?

As discussed in Fort Pierce, Tripp Scott is that insurance policy I've been 
looking for to help secure the commission vote in Pompano.  Tripp Scott will 
also assist us in our door knock campaign in the County & Tallahassee.  
Pozzuoli is a mover & shaker and is on a first name basis with Jeb Bush -  he 
was the Chairman for the Bush/Cheny Broward County re-count.

Bill Keith & Debbie Orshefsky highly recommends the engagement.

Lets discuss Tuesday.
