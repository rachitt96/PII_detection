Kay and George:

We have enclosed yet another set of "final" drafts of the LLC Agreement
marked to reflect revisions from the drafts circulated earlier today. I have
included George's suggested revision to Section 2.5 addressing the effective
date and also revised the definition of "Letter Agreement." Thanks.
