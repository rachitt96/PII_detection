Message Body :Kay,

This appears to be relatively simple ( and I know that we wanted to have ABB 
haul and install) but I am not at all familiar with the ABB Contract.  
Would you mind taking a quick look to make sure that the letter is properly 
drafted?  Also, I wonder whether this document still needs to be signed given 
that the transformers are already in Austin at the site.  Maybe it has 
already been executed.

If it says Austin, it must be yours....

Mike:

Attached is a draft letter which provides authorization to ABB for the haul & 
install option at Austin.

After it has been signed, please send me a copy for my files.

Thank you.
Kathy
