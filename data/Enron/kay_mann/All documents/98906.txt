Ben
I understand from Bill Monahan that you wanted to see confidentiality
agreements currently outstanding from insurance company.

We submitted agreements to Chuck Newell and Sharon West.  Chuck's executed
agreement has been received but we are still waiting for Sharon.  We had
emailed Chris Booth to request status however we now understand he is out on
vacation this week

Attached is a copy of agreement documentation (4 pages) sent to Sharon West
and currently outstanding.
