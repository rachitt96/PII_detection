Message Body :Kay,

Item 4 - of the Beck comments

The "must run" condition is when Entergy calls up and declares an emergency, 
Clarksdale has to generate or they have no power.

In a previous version of the LOI David and I had the following language:

Profit from external sales of The Cities, power and gas resources and savings 
realized by purchase of on-peak market power would be split 60% to The Cities 
and 40% to EPMI except under first contingency 32 MW &must run8 conditions. 
If not already running, &must run8 periods will be excluded from the profit 
loss calculation.  

Something like this could go und the Structure section as item D following 
the "EPMI would be compensated..." sentence which should be item C.
