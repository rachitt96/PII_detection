Message Body :Kay - This CA covered the audit aspect of enovate.  Were you envisioning that 
this would also cover the individuals in enovate or will there be a separate 
CA that both Enron and Peoples employees will sign?  If there will be a 
separate CA, can you give me an ETA?  I need to get something to John Nassos 
to review prior to delivering it to the enovate people.

Thanks - Gregg

John,

I think I misspoke (or miswrote).  The change I suggested would belong in 
both versions.
