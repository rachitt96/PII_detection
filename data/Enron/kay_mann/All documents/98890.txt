Carlos,
I have added some language that briefly describes the unit protection 
product.  Mike Kelly or the folks from Enron Global Markets will have to 
approve the final language for their product.  Please note that we can,t call 
this an insurance product.  Terri Clynes will be sending comments on the term 
sheet later today.

Doug,

see attached term sheet for NMC (Arpin, WI site).  Please provide comments 
and changes as appropriate (plus add language for your insurance product in 
the place holder).

Carlos,

Doug and I will provide you background.  I am not sure if you are the 
appropriate Legal Support (please direct us to the appropriate person if you 
are not).

This is a starting point and is fairly general (to facilitate discussions 
with NMC).

Thanks, Ron.
