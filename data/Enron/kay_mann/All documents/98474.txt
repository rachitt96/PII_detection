Message Body :Matt,

Why do I have to pay for the cranes at GE's factory to get the turbine on a 
rail car?  Section 10.2 1 states that the Seller shall be responsible for 
loading Purchaser's mode of transportation upon arrival to the Delivery Point.

Also, I would expect crane would also be available at New Port News (major 
shipyard) and Houston to off-load the turbine and or generator.

Chris,

In response to your inquiry, the following is the cost breakout for the GE 
storage quote:

$50,000 = Long Term Preservation Procedures on the GTG
$198, 000 = Transportation to the storage yard (contract ref: Exhibit N-1)
$78,500 = Handling Costs (cranes) to upload on the method of transportation
$78,500 = Handling Costs (cranes) to offload in the storage yard
$64,000 = Storage costs through 30 JUN 01 (16k per month for MAR, APR, MAY, & 
JUN)

TOTAL = $469,000

Costs that are incurred "up-front" are 1,2,3,& 4.  After discussing this with 
GE, this is their Lump Sum price.
