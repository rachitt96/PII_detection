Message Body :Kay:

My only comment is in Section 5(e). The specific reference to Article 19.2 of 
the Facility Agreement should be deleted, and the paragraph should read 
"...as may be required pursuant to the Facility Agreement, ...".

I'd like to be able to send this out on Tuesday. Please let me, Fred and 
Chris know when you have reviewed this draft.

Thanks,

Ben
