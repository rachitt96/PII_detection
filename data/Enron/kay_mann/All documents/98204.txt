Message Body :A couple of us have been discussing having a spa weekend at the Lake Austin 
Spa following the legal conference in San Antonio.   I've checked with the 
Spa, and they will give us a group rate for 6 or more folks staying at least 
two nights (usually they require 3 nights), beginning May 4th.  The cost will 
be north of $1000 (single) including food and activities.  Spa services will 
be extra.  The Spa has a great website at www.lakeaustinspa.com.  

It will be a good idea to block some rooms fairly soon, although the drop 
dead commitment date will come later.  Please let me know if you have any 
interest in joining us.

Kay
